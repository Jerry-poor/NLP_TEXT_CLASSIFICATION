Title:  Human-computer interaction; Ambient-intelligence; Fuzzy-logic; User interfaces        
Abstract: One of the main problems of Ambient Intelligence systems is that developers have to design and implement different user interfaces for each combination of user and environmental characteristics. This paper deals with alleviating this problem through the implementation of a UI development framework, called Dandelion, which postpones until run-time the implementation of the UI for a specific scenario. In particular, we address the autonomous evaluation of the adequateness of interaction devices for the scenario in order to facilitate the final automatic generation of an adapted UI.

Title:  complications (lung clinical); fungal (infection); quality of life (quality of life    ethics    economics); solid tumor (malignancy and long-term complications)      
Abstract: Lung transplant recipients (LTR) are at high risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Voriconazole exposure after lung transplant has recently been reported as a risk factor for SCC. We sought to study the relationship between fungal prophylaxis with voriconazole and the risk of SCC in sequential cohorts from a single center. We evaluated 400 adult LTR at UCLA between 7/1/2005 and 12/22/2012. On 7/1/2009, our center instituted a protocol switch from targeted to universal antifungal prophylaxis for at least 6 months post-transplant. Using Cox proportional hazards models, time to SCC was compared between targeted (N = 199) and universal (N = 201) prophylaxis cohorts. Cox models were also used to assess SCC risk as a function of time-dependent cumulative exposure to voriconazole and other antifungal agents. The risk of SCC was greater in the universal prophylaxis cohort (HR 2.02, P < 0.01). Voriconazole exposure was greater in the universal prophylaxis cohort, and the cumulative exposure to voriconazole was associated with SCC (HR 1.75, P < 0.01), even after adjustment for other important SCC risk factors. Voriconazole did not increase the risk of advanced tumors. Exposure to other antifungal agents was not associated with SCC. Voriconazole should be used cautiously in this population.

Title:  acrylamide; glycidamide; human metabolism; toxicokinetics; human exposure; daily intake; mercapturic acids; hemoglobin adducts        
Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways of acrylamide (AA) in the nonsmoking general population. For the first time both the blood protein adducts and the urinary metabolites of AA and glycidamide (GA) were quantified in an especially designed study group with even distribution of age and gender. The hemoglobin adducts N-carbamoylethylvaline (AAVal) and N-(R,S)-2-hydroxy-2-carbamoylethylvaline (GAVal) were detected by GC-MS/MS in all blood samples with median levels of 30 and 34 pmol/g of globin, respectively. Concentrations ranged from 15 to 71 pmol/g of globin for AAVal and from 14 to 66 pmol/g of globin for GAVal. The ratio GAVal/AAVal was 0.4-2.7 (median = 1.1). The urinary metabolites were determined by LC-MS/MS. Of all urine samples examined 99% of N-acetyl-S-(2-carbamoylethyl)-L-cysteine (AAMA) levels and 73% of N-(R/S)-acetyl-S-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-L-cysteine (GAMA) levels were above the LOD (1.5 mu g/L). Concentrations ranged from < LOD to 229 mu g/L (median = 29 mu g/L) for AAMA and from < LOD to 85 mu g/L (median = 7 mu g/L) for GAMA. The ratio of GAMA/AAMA varied from 0.004 to 1.4 (median = 0.3). Using hemoglobin adduct levels in blood and mercapturic acid excretion in urine for calculation of daily AA intake gave practically identical values. The median daily intakes were 0.43 (0.21-1.04) mu g/kg of body weight(bw)/day using Hb adducts and 0.51 (< LOD-2.32) mu g/kg of bw/day using mercapturic acids for calculations. Children take up approximately 1.3-1.5 times more AA per kilogram of body weight than adults. The ratio GAMA/AAMA is significantly higher in the group of young children (6-10 years) with a median level of 0.5. A gender-related difference in internal exposure and metabolism was not observed.

Title:  Fibroblast; Aloe vera (A.v); bFGF; TGF beta 1        
Abstract: Background: Aloe vera (A. v) have been used traditionally for topical treatment of wounds and burns in different countries for centuries, but the mechanism of this effect is not well understood. Various growth factors are implicated in the process of wound healing. Among the different growth factors involved in the process, TGF beta 1 and bFGF are the most importantly expressed in fibroblast cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of A. v on the expression of angiogenesis growth factors in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Methods: We exposed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells to different concentrations of A. v (50, 100 and 150 mu g/ml) at two different time of 12 and 24 h. Fibroblast cell without A. v treatment serves as the control. The expression of TGF beta 1 and bFGF was measured by real time-polymerase chain reaction (real-time-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the level of gene and protein. Results: We observed that A.v gel at first up-regulated the expression of TGF beta 1 and bFGF, but, these genes were later repressed after a particular time. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that A. v was dose-dependent and time-dependent on the expression of bFGF and TGFb1 in fibroblast cell in vitro. This mechanism can be employed in the prospective treatment of physical lesion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Title:  Nanofiber membrane; Electrospinning; Boron removal; Surface grafting; Adsorption        
Abstract: The development of efficient adsorbents with high sorption capacity remains as a challenge for the removal of micropollutants occurred globally in water resources. In this work, poly (amic acid) (PAA) electrospun nanofiber membranes grafted with hyperbranched polyols were synthesized and used for boron removal. The PAA nanofiber was reacted with hyperbranched polyethylenimine (HPEI) and further with glycidol to introduce the vicinal hydroxyl groups. The chemical composition and surface characteristics of the obtained PAA-g-PG membranes were evaluated by FESEM, FTIR, XPS and water contact angles (WCA) measurements. The boron adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics were investigated systematically. The results showed that the PAA nanofiber spun from concentration of 15% had uniform morphology and narrow diameter distribution. The PAA-g-PG nanofiber membrane had a maximum boron uptake of 5.68 mmol/g and could adsorb 0.82 mmol/g boron from a 5 mg/L solution in 15 min. Both the high surface area of nanofibers and the hyperbranched structure should contribute to the high boron uptake and high adsorption rate. The nanofiber membrane obeyed the Langmuir adsorption model and the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The regeneration efficiency of the nanofiber membrane remained 93.9% after 10 cycled uses, indicating good regenerability of the membrane. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Affinity tag; Fc; Fc-fusion; recombinant protein; stability        
Abstract: Affinity tags are vital tools for the production of high-throughput recombinant proteins. Several affinity tags, such as the hexahistidine tag, maltose-binding protein, streptavidin-binding peptide tag, calmodulin-binding peptide, c-Myc tag, glutathione S-transferase and FLAG tag, have been introduced for recombinant protein production. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the IgG1 antibody is one of the useful affinity tags that can facilitate detection, purification and localization of proteins and can improve the immunogenicity, modulatory effects, physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of proteins. Fc recombinant forms a group of recombinant proteins called Fc-fusion proteins (FFPs). FFPs are widely used in drug discovery, drug delivery, vaccine design and experimental research on receptor-ligand interactions. These fusion proteins have become successful alternatives to monoclonal antibodies for drug developments. In this review, the physicochemical, biochemical, immunological, pharmaceutical and therapeutic properties of recombinant FFPs were discussed as a new generation of bioengineering strategies.

Title:  Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease; Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin; superantigen; superantibody; basophil        
Abstract: Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is associated with local immunoglobulin hyperproduction and the presence of IgE antibodies against Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (SAEs). Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a severe form of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in which nearly all patients express anti-SAEs. Objectives: We aimed to understand antibodies reactive to SAEs and determine whether they recognize SAEs through their complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or framework regions. Methods: Labeled staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A, SED, and SEE were used to isolate single SAE-specific B cells from the nasal polyps of 3 patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Recombinant antibodies with ""matched"" heavy and light chains were cloned as IgG(1), and those of high affinity for specific SAEs, assayed by means of ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, were recloned as IgE and antigen-binding fragments. IgE activities were tested in basophil degranulation assays. Results: Thirty-seven SAE-specific, IgG- or IgA-expressing B cells were isolated and yielded 6 anti-SAE clones, 2 each for SEA, SED, and SEE. Competition binding assays revealed that the anti-SEE antibodies recognize nonoverlapping epitopes in SEE. Unexpectedly, each anti-SEE mediated SEE-induced basophil degranulation, and IgG(1) or antigen-binding fragments of each anti-SEE enhanced degranulation by the other anti-SEE. Conclusions: SEEs can activate basophils by simultaneously binding as antigens in the conventional manner to CDRs and as superantigens to framework regions of anti-SEE IgE in anti-SEE IgE-Fc epsilon RI complexes. Anti-SEE IgG(1)s can enhance the activity of anti-SEE IgEs as conventional antibodies through CDRs or simultaneously as conventional antibodies and as ""superantibodies"" through CDRs and framework regions to SEEs in SEE-anti-SEE IgE-Fc epsilon RI complexes.

Title:  sleep; operant extinction; recent memory; remote memory; generalization; context        
Abstract: Operant extinction is learning to supress a previously rewarded behavior. It is known to be strongly associated with the specific context in which it was acquired, which limits the therapeutic use of operant extinction in behavioral treatments, e. g., of addiction. We examined whether sleep influences contextual memory of operant extinction over time, using two different recall tests (Recent and Remote). Rats were trained in an operant conditioning task (lever press) in context A, then underwent extinction training in context B, followed by a 3-h retention period that contained either spontaneous morning sleep, morning sleep deprivation, or spontaneous evening wakefulness. A recall test was performed either immediately after the 3-h experimental retention period (Recent recall) or after 48 h (Remote), in the extinction context B and in a novel context C. The two main findings were: (i) at the Recent recall test, sleep in comparison with sleep deprivation and spontaneous wakefulness enhanced extinction memory but, only in the extinction context B; (ii) at the Remote recall, extinction performance after sleep was enhanced in both contexts B and C to an extent comparable to levels at Recent recall in context B. Interestingly, extinction performance at Remote recall was also improved in the sleep deprivation groups in both contexts, with no difference to performance in the sleep group. Our results suggest that 3 h of post-learning sleep transiently facilitate the context specificity of operant extinction at a Recent recall. However, the improvement and contextual generalization of operant extinction memory observed in the long-term, i. e., after 48 h, does not require immediate post-learning sleep.

Title:  Viral load; host genetic factors; viral diagnostic; syndromic diagnosis; point of care; HIV; HCV; HPV; RSV; IL28B; ITPA        
Abstract: Introduction: The development of quantitative methods for the detection of viral nucleic acids have significantly improved our ability to manage disease progression and to assess the efficacy of antiviral treatment. Moreover, major advances in molecular technologies during the last decade have allowed the identification of new host genetic markers associated with antiviral drug response but have also strongly revolutionized the way we see and perform virus diagnostics in the coming years.Areas covered: In this review, we describe the history and development of virology diagnostic methods, dedicating particular emphasis on the gradual evolution and recent advances toward the introduction of multiparametric platforms for the syndromic diagnosis. In parallel, we outline the consolidation of viral genome quantification practice in different clinical settings.Expert commentary: More rapid, accurate and affordable molecular technology can be predictable with particular emphasis on emerging techniques (next generation sequencing, digital PCR, point of care testing and syndromic diagnosis) to simplify viral diagnosis in the next future.

Title:  genome editing; targeted mutagenesis; engineered nucleases; double-strand break repair; homologous recombination; technical advance        
Abstract: The CRISPR/Cas nuclease is becoming a major tool for targeted mutagenesis in eukaryotes by inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) at pre-selected genomic sites that are repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in an error-prone way. In plants, it could be demonstrated that the Cas9 nuclease is able to induce heritable mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. Gene targeting (GT) by homologous recombination (HR) can also be induced by DSBs. Using a natural nuclease and marker genes, we previously developed an in planta GT strategy in which both a targeting vector and targeting locus are activated simultaneously via DSB induction during plant development. Here, we demonstrate that this strategy can be used for natural genes by CRISPR/Cas-mediated DSB induction. We were able to integrate a resistance cassette into the ADH1 locus of A.thaliana via HR. Heritable events were identified using a PCR-based genotyping approach, characterised by Southern blotting and confirmed on the sequence level. A major concern is the specificity of the CRISPR/Cas nucleases. Off-target effects might be avoided using two adjacent sgRNA target sequences to guide the Cas9 nickase to each of the two DNA strands, resulting in the formation of a DSB. By amplicon deep sequencing, we demonstrate that this Cas9 paired nickase strategy has a mutagenic potential comparable with that of the nuclease, while the resulting mutations are mostly deletions. We also demonstrate the stable inheritance of such mutations in A.thaliana.

Title:  Phyllite; Shear creep; Softening effect; Creep parameters        
Abstract: Along with the thorough development of underground engineering, people pay more attention on the long-term deformation stability of the tunnels. However, creep characteristic is an important factor to arouse surrounding rock deformation failures and control engineering designs. Phyllite is a common soft rock in engineering practice, when sample is saturated, water will not only impose the softening effect on phyllite, but also it will influence their creep mechanical properties under the long-term loads. In this paper, selecting samples from headrace tunnel GaoPingpu hydropower station in China, we carried out the shear creep test of saturated phyllite along the schistosity surface under different stress levels. Further, we systematically analyzed and compared the test results with the samples in air-dried conditions, and found that water has great effects on the strength of phyllite: the long-term strength and yield stress of saturated phyllite are only 70-78 and 75-89 % of the air-dried ones respectively. At the same time, based on the Burgers creep model, we discussed the impacts of water on the creep parameters' values of phyllite. This result can provide a theoretical basis to calculate the creep deformation of the tunnel surrounding rocks.

Title:  Prevalence; Pain; HIV/AIDS        
Abstract: Background: Pain is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in people living with HIV/AIDS, whether or not they are receiving anti-retroviral therapy. A recent systematic review identified a paucity of studies exploring pain in women in low and middle income countries. The prevalence and characteristics of pain in women living with HIV/AIDS may differ from that of men as many chronic pain conditions are more prevalent in women. The aims of this study were to establish pain prevalence, characteristics and management in amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, we aimed to identify whether there were associations between pain in this population and the psychosocial factors of employment, education, self-efficacy, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, health related quality of life and childhood trauma. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 229 women who had undergone HIV testing and were registered patients at a community health centre was conducted. Data were collected by interview with a demographic questionnaire, the Brief Pain Inventory-Xhosa, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Xhosa, Harvard Trauma Questionnaire-Xhosa for PTSD, Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale-Xhosa; the EQ-5D health related quality of life instrument, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: 170 of the women had pain, a prevalence rate of 74.24% (95% CI 68.2 -79.47%). The women reported significant pain with pain severity of 5.06 +/- 1.57 and pain interference of 6.39 +/- 1.96 out of 10. Only two women were receiving adequate pain management according to the pain management index. Participants reported a mean of 2.42 +/- 1.21 different anatomical sites of pain. There were more unemployed participants in the group with pain and they had significantly fewer years of schooling. Those with pain had lower self-efficacy; health related quality of life and increased depression and PTSD symptom severity. Conclusion: This study highlights that pain is a common problem for amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS. These data emphasise the need to prioritise pain assessment and management in amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS. Routinely assessing for the presence of pain in women with HIV/AIDS has the potential to improve pain management and minimise the impact of pain on function.

Title:  XET; litchi fruit; cracking; growth; NAA        
Abstract: Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET) catalyses the transglycosylation of xyloglucan, the major hemicellulose polymer, which has been thought to mediate the cross-linking of cellulose microfibrils in cellular walls and proposed to be involved in the control of cell wall relaxation. To understand the relationship between litchi fruit cracking and gene expression patterns, three XET genes from litchi fruit were identified and then examined for their expression profiles in pericarp and aril tissues at different development stages, using a cracking-resistant cultivar, 'Huaizhi', and a cracking-susceptible cultivar, 'Nuomici'. Three full-length cDNAs of 1267, 1095 and 1156 bp encoding XETs, named LcXET1, LcXET2 and LcXET3, respectively, were isolated from expanding fruit using RT-PCR and RACE-PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) methods. Northern blotting analysis showed that LcXET1 mRNA accumulation occurred much earlier in aril tissues at 59 days after anthesis (DAA) than in pericarp tissues at 73 DAA in 'Nuomici'. However, it appeared at almost the same time (66 DAA) in pericarp and aril tissues in 'Huaizhi'. which suggested that differential accumulation of LcXET1 in pericarp and aril tissues in 'Nuomici' and 'Huaizhi' was closely associated with fruit cracking. LcXET2 mRNA accumulation could be detected in pericarp and aril tissues throughout fruit development but exhibited a differential accumulation pattern between pericarp and aril tissues. In the aril of 'Nuomici', intensive signal bands were detectable at 59-73 DAA in rapidly expanding fruits of 'Nuomici' but only weak bands could be found in the pericarp tissues. In contrast, moderate signal bands were detectable both in pericarp and aril tissues of 'Huaizhi' fruits. Furthermore, LeXET3 showed constitutive expression in both pericarp and aril tissues of developing 'Nuomici' and 'Huaizhi' litchi fruit. In addition, differential expression patterns of three XETs genes were observed in different tissues of litchi, with only LcXET1 being fruit-specific. To further address the role of LcXET in fruit cracking, alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) was used to treat 'Nuomoci' to reduce fruit cracking. Enhanced LcXET1 mRNA accumulation appeared in pericarp while LcXET2 and LeXET3 mRNTA accumulation enhanced in aril tissues in the NAA-treated fruits. Thus, LcXET1 is more likely to play a role in reducing litchi fruit cracking than LcXET2 and LcXET3. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Title:  ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS; SPONDYLOARTHRITIS; OUTCOMES; TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR INHIBITORS        
Abstract: Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of radiographic spinal progression and disease activity on function and spinal mobility in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors for up to 10 years. Methods. Patients with AS who participated in 2 longterm open-label extensions of clinical trials with TNF-alpha inhibitors (43 receiving infliximab and 17 receiving etanercept) were included in this analysis based on the availability of spinal radiographs performed at baseline and at a later timepoint (yr 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) during followup. Spinal radiographs were scored according to the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS). Function was assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), spinal mobility by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), and disease activity by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). Results. After the initial improvement, BASFI and BASMI remained remarkably stable at low levels over up to 10 years despite radiographic spinal progression. In the generalized mixed effects model analysis, no association between the mSASSS and the BASFI change (beta = 0.0, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03) was found, while there was some effect of mSASSS changes on BASMI changes over time (beta = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.09). BASDAI showed a strong association with function (beta = 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.73) and to a lesser extent, with spinal mobility (beta = 0.14, 95% CI 0.01-0.26). Conclusion. Functional status and spinal mobility of patients with established AS remained stable during longterm anti-TNF-alpha therapy despite radiographic progression. This indicates that reduction and continuous control of inflammation might be able to outweigh the functional effect of structural damage progression in AS.

Title:  perceived stress; stress; headache; adolescence; Ecological Momentary Assessment        
Abstract: As part of a larger study on perceived stress and headaches in 2009, momentary perceived stress, head pain levels and stress-related symptom data were collected. This paper explores a temporal analysis of the patterns of stress, as well as an analysis of momentary and retrospective stress-related symptoms compared by level of headache activity. Adolescent girls (N=31) ages 14-18 were randomly cued by electronic diaries 7 times per day over a 21day period responding to momentary questions about level of head pain, perceived stress and stress-related symptoms. Multivariate general linear modelling was used to determine significant differences among headache groups in relation to temporal patterns of stress. Significant headache group differences were found on retrospective and momentary stress-related symptom measures. A total of 2841 diary responses captured stress levels, head pain and related symptoms. The chronic headache (CH) group reported the highest levels of hourly and daily stress, followed by the moderate headache (MH) and low headache (LH) groups. Patterns of stress for the three headache groups were statistically distinct, illustrating increased stress in girls with more frequent head pain. This evidence suggests that because of increased stress, girls with recurrent head pain are likely a vulnerable population who may benefit from stress-reducing interventions.

Title:  Emergency contraception; Ulipristal; Copper IUD; Levonorgestrel        
Abstract: Objectives: To assess knowledge and provision of emergency contraception (EC), particularly the most effective methods. Study design: A web-based survey was distributed to a cross-sectional convenience sample of healthcare providers across specialties treating reproductive-aged women. The survey was sent to 3260 practicing physicians and advanced practice clinicians in 14 academic centers between February 2013 and April 2014. We analyzed responses by provider specialty using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The fmal sample included 1684 providers (response rate=51.7%). Ninety-five percent of the respondents had heard of levonorgestrel (LNG) EC. Among reproductive health specialists, 81% provide LNG EC in their practice, although only half (52%) had heard of ulipristal acetate (UPA) and very few provide it (14%). The majority in family medicine (69%) and emergency medicine (74%) provide LNG, in contrast to 42% of internists and 55% of pediatricians. However, the more effective methods [UPA and copper intrauterine device (IUD)] were little known and rarely provided outside of reproductive health specialties; 18% of internists and 14% of emergency medicine providers had heard of UPA and 4% provide it. Only 22% of emergency providers and 32% of pediatricians had heard of the copper IUD used as EC. Among reproductive health specialists, only 36% provide copper IUD as EC in their practice. Specialty, provider type and proportion of women of reproductive age in the practice were related to knowledge and provision of some forms of EC. Conclusions: Awareness and provision of the most effective EC methods, UPA and the copper IUD (which are provider dependent), are substantially lower than for LNG EC, especially among providers who do not focus on reproductive health. Implications: In our sample of 1684 healthcare providers from diverse specialties who treat reproductive-aged women, knowledge and provision of the most effective forms of EC (UPA and the copper IUD) are far lower than for LNG EC. Women should be offered the full range of EC methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Matrix Metaloproteinase-1; Zoanthamine alkaloid class; Docking; Molecular dynamics simulation; MM-PB/GBSA        
Abstract: Zoanthamine-type alkaloids display a wide spectrum of biological effects. This study aimed to examine the inhibitory effects of norzoanthamine and its ten homologues of zoanthamine class on human fibroblast collagenase by modeling a three-dimensional structure of the ligands at collagenase using energy minimization, docking, molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PB/GBSA binding free energy calculations. The results showed that zoanthamide, zooxathellamine and enol-iminium form of norzoanthamine, with lower binding free energies than other compounds, are potent inhibitors of collagenase. However, the enol-iminium form of norzoanthamine showed a more inhibitory activity against collagenase than its keto form. This suggests that it can be used for treatment of many diseases such as osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Zinc-binding residues such as His 118, His 122 and His 128 for hydrogen bonds and Leu 81, Tyr 110, Val 115, Leu 126, Pro 138, Ser 139 for hydrophobic interactions should be considered for designing an inhibitor for collagenase. Our theoretical results and MM/GBSA binding free energy calculations are consistent with experimental studies.

Title:  rheumatoid arthritis; in vivo hypoxia imaging; PET; HIF; ROS        
Abstract: Hypoxia is essential for the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is associated with the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), because of the enhanced infiltration of immune cells. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring hypoxia noninvasively in vivo in arthritic ankles with PET/MRI using the hypoxia tracers F-18-fluoromisonidazole (F-18-FMISO) and F-18-fluoroazomycinarabinoside (F-18-FAZA). Additionally, we quantified the temporal dynamics of hypoxia and ROS stress using L-012, an ROS-sensitive chemiluminescence optical imaging probe, and analyzed the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Methods: Mice underwent noninvasive in vivo PET/MRI to measure hypoxia or optical imaging to analyze ROS expression. Additionally, we performed ex vivo pimonidazole-/HIF-1 alpha immunohistochemistry and HIF-1 alpha/2 alpha Western blot/messenger RNA analysis of inflamed and healthy ankles to confirm our in vivo results. Results: Mice diseased from experimental RA exhibited a 3-fold enhancement in hypoxia tracer uptake, even in the early disease stages, and a 45-fold elevation in ROS expression in inflamed ankles compared with the ankles of healthy controls. We further found strong correlations of our noninvasive in vivo hypoxia PET data with pimonidazole and expression of HIF-1 alpha in arthritic ankles. The strongest hypoxia tracer uptake was observed as soon as day 3, whereas the most pronounced ROS stress was evident on day 6 after the onset of experimental RA, indicating that tissue hypoxia can precede ROS stress in RA. Conclusion: Collectively, for the first time to our knowledge, we have demonstrated that the noninvasive measurement of hypoxia in inflammation using F-18-FAZA and F-18-FMISO PET imaging represents a promising new tool for uncovering and monitoring rheumatic inflammation in vivo. Further, because hypoxic inflamed tissues are associated with the overexpression of HIFs, specific inhibition of HIFs might represent a new powerful treatment strategy.

Title:  Cancer; carbohydrate recognition domain; galectin-9; immune-regulation; linker peptide        
Abstract: Galectins is a family of non-classically secreted, beta-galactoside-binding proteins that has recently received considerable attention in the spatio-temporal regulation of surface 'signal lattice' organization, membrane dynamics, cell-adhesion and disease therapeutics. Galectin-9 is a unique member of this family, with two non-homologous carbohydrate recognition domains joined by a linker peptide sequence of variable lengths, generating isoforms with distinct properties and functions in both physiological and pathological settings, such as during development, immune reaction, neoplastic transformations and metastasis. In this review, we summarize the latest knowledge on the structure, receptors, cellular targets, trafficking pathways and functional properties of galectin-9 and discuss how galectin-9-mediated signalling cascades can be exploited in cancers and immunotherapies.

Title:  Public-transport network; General transit feed specification; Network topology; Node-degree distribution; Average (shortest) path length; Average network clustering coefficient        
Abstract: This work presents a new method of examining the structure of public-transport networks (PTNs) and analyzes their topological properties through a combination of computer programming, statistical data and large-network analyses. In order to automate the extraction, processing and exporting of data, a software program was developed allowing to extract the needed data from General Transit Feed Specification, thus overcoming difficulties occurring in accessing and collecting data. The proposed method was applied to a real-life PTNin Auckland, New Zealand, with the purpose of examining whether it showed characteristics of scale-free networks and exhibited features of ""small-world"" networks. As a result, new regression equations were derived analytically describing observed, strong, non-linear relationships among the probabilities of randomly chosen stops in the PTN to be serviced by a given number of routes. The established dependence is best fitted by an exponential rather than a power-law function, showing that the PTN examined is neither random nor scale-free, but a mixture of the two. This finding explains the presence of hubs that are not typical of exponential networks and simultaneously not highly connected to the other nodes as is the case with scale-free networks. On the other hand, the observed values of the topological properties of the network show that although it is highly clustered, owing to its representation as a directed graph, it differs slightly from ""small-world"" networks, which are characterized by strong clustering and a short average path length.

Title:  Cloud computing; Building information model; Big data analysis; Web3D; Bigtable; MapReduce        
Abstract: This paper presents a cloud-based system framework based on Bigtable and MapReduce as the data storage and processing paradigms for providing a web-based service for viewing, storing, and analyzing massive building information models (BIMs). Cloud and Web 3D technologies were utilized to develop a BIM data center that can handle the big data of massive BlMs using multiple servers in a distributed manner and can be accessed by multiple users to concurrently submit and view BIMs online in 3D. Traditional BIM include only static information such as the geometric parameters, physical properties, and spatial relations for modeling a physical space. In this study, BIM was extended to dynamic BIM, which includes dynamic data such as historical records from the monitoring of the facility environment and usage. Owing to this extension, a dynamic BIM became a parametric model, which can be used to simulate user behaviors. On the client side, this study applied WebGL in the web interface development to achieve the display of BIMs in 3D on browsers. Users can access the services via various online devices anytime and anywhere to view the 3D model online. On the server side, this study used Apache Hadoop, which can utilize multiple servers to provide mass storage spaces in a distributed manner with Bigtable-like structured storage, to establish the BIM data center. A schema for storing the big data of massive dynamic BIMs in Bigtables was proposed. MapReduce, a Hadoop component for the parallel processing of large data sets, was utilized to process big data from dynamic BIMs. A big data analysis framework to effectively retrieve and calculate required information from dynamic BIMs in the data center for various applications by MapReduce distributed computing was proposed this study. We provide principle and architecture of the proposed framework along with its experimental assessment. The results confirmed that scalable and reliable management of massive BIMs can be achieved using the proposed framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  scientific computation; parallel computation; geodynamics; mid-ocean ridge; PETSc        
Abstract: Geodynamics simulations are characterized by theological nonlinearity, localization, three-dimensional effects, and separate but interacting length scales. These features represent a challenge for computational science. We discuss how a leading software framework for advanced scientific computing (the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation, PETSc) can facilitate the development of geodynamics simulations. To illustrate our use of PETSc, we describe simulations of (i) steady-state, non-Newtonian passive flow and thermal structure beneath a mid-ocean ridge, (ii) magmatic solitary waves in the mantle, and (iii) the formation of localized bands of high porosity in a two-phase medium being deformed under simple shear. We highlight two supplementary features of PETSc, structured storage of application parameters and self-documenting output, that are especially useful for geodynamics simulations.

Title:  Topic modeling; LDA; LSI; Survey        
Abstract: Researchers in software engineering have attempted to improve software development by mining and analyzing software repositories. Since the majority of the software engineering data is unstructured, researchers have applied Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to help software development. The recent advances of IR, especially statistical topic models, have helped make sense of unstructured data in software repositories even more. However, even though there are hundreds of studies on applying topic models to software repositories, there is no study that shows how the models are used in the software engineering research community, and which software engineering tasks are being supported through topic models. Moreover, since the performance of these topic models is directly related to the model parameters and usage, knowing how researchers use the topic models may also help future studies make optimal use of such models. Thus, we surveyed 167 articles from the software engineering literature that make use of topic models. We find that i) most studies centre around a limited number of software engineering tasks; ii) most studies use only basic topic models; iii) and researchers usually treat topic models as black boxes without fully exploring their underlying assumptions and parameter values. Our paper provides a starting point for new researchers who are interested in using topic models, and may help new researchers and practitioners determine how to best apply topic models to a particular software engineering task.

Title:  CUDA; FFT; GPGPU; GPU computing; many-core architecture; micromagnetics; OpenCL; parallel computing        
Abstract: Recent graphic processing units (GPUs) have remarkable raw computing power, which can be used for very computationally challenging problems. Like in micromagnetic simulations, where the magnetostatic field computation to analyze the magnetic behavior at very small time and space scale demands a huge computation time. This paper presents a multidimensional FFT-based parallel implementation of a magnetostatic field computation on GPUs. We have developed a specialized 3D FFT library for magnetostatic field calculation on GPUs. This made it possible to fully exploit the symmetries inherent in the field calculation and other optimizations specific to the GPUs architecture. We have compared our results with the widely used CPU-based parallel OOMMF program and with an equivalent serial implementation on CPU. The results have shown a speedup of up to 95x and 8.7x for single and 66x and 4.6x for double precision floating point accuracy against equivalent serial implementation and OOMMF, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper we present a current-mode electronically tunable multifunction frequency filter that behavior is equivalent to the well known KHN filter. The proposed structure has one low-impedance input with zero potential and three high-impedance outputs with low-, band- and high-pass responses. The mutually independent control of the quality factor Q and natural frequency omega(0) is made by electronically tunable current conveyors ECCII. The behavior of the structure has been verified by Spice simulations and, furthermore, by experimental measurements, where AC and transient analyses have been performed.

Abstract: Adolescent stress-related growth refers to enhancement in an adolescent's cognitive-affective or social resources as a result of experiencing stressors. We tested whether adolescents reporting high levels of stress-related growth showed superior adaptation outcomes on a day-to-day basis. Participants (n = 91; females = 46, age = 14) completed a questionnaire measure of stress-related growth and kept a diary of emotional and interpersonal functioning for 10 consecutive days. Individual differences in cognitive-affective stress-related growth moderated associations between daily stress levels and adaptive coping behaviors, whereas individual differences in social stress-related growth moderated associations between daily mother-child conflict and end-of-day negative affect. This study provides the first empirical demonstration of domain-specific forms of stress-related growth during adolescence.

Title:  Autism spectrum disorder; Pervasive developmental disorder; Developmental and speech delay        
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly seen in children. It is characterized by age inappropriate, impaired social communication and the presence of stereotypic behavior. This disorder is hypothesized to result from cerebral dysfunction arising from a complex interaction between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. ASD should be suspected in children failing ASD specific screening tests, in the presence of red flags in social, language and/or play domains, in children with developmental or language delay, abnormal behavior, poor school performance or in those who are at high risk. Comprehensive assessment comprises of a step-wise approach that includes taking a detailed history, performing a holistic examination and observing the child closely in relation to play, social interaction and behavior. Diagnosis is established by application of the diagnostic criteria for ASD of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM V). The degree of severity, intellectual and language impairment and presence of other illnesses should be specified. Functional assessment identifies an individual's strengths and weaknesses. All these are important to formulate a customized intervention plan along with the family. The goal is to build up skills enabling optimal and as far as possible normal functioning while simultaneously reducing maladaptive behavior. This is achieved by a multi-disciplinary team comprising of various personnel experienced in tackling issues in ASD related to their respective areas of expertise. Intervention is primarily non-pharmacological, based on behavioral modification strategies. Drugs are only indicated in the reduction of target symptoms refractory to behavioral intervention. Although there is no cure, timely and appropriate intervention can improve the quality of life significantly.

Title:  Multi-objective analysis; Artificial bee colony; Differential evolution; Time-cost-quality tradeoff; Construction management        
Abstract: Time, cost, and quality are three important but often conflicting factors that must be optimally balanced during the planning and management of construction projects. Tradeoff optimization among these three factors within the project scope is necessary to maximize overall project success. In this paper, the MOA-BCDE-TCQT, a new hybrid multiple objective evolutionary algorithm that is based on hybridization of artificial bee colony and differential evolution, is proposed to solve time-cost-quality tradeoff problems. The proposed algorithm integrates crossover operations from differential evolution (DE) with the original artificial bee colony (ABC) in order to balance the exploration and exploitation phases of the optimization process. A numerical construction project case study demonstrates the ability of MOA-BCDE-generated, non-dominated solutions to assist project managers to select an appropriate plan to optimize TCQT, which is an operation that is typically difficult and time-consuming. Comparisons between the MOA-BCDE and four currently used algorithms, including the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), the multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), the multiple objective differential evolution (MODE), and the multiple objective artificial bee colony (MOABC), verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed algorithm.

Title:  inflammation; sports injury; omega-3 fatty acids; resolvins        
Abstract: Sport injuries are common and costly for the professional athlete, the weekend warrior, and the community. Acute injuries are treated according to current guidelines with the aim of bringing the athlete back into the arena. These guidelines have not taken into account new scientific results of the inflammatory process following a trauma. The 4 hallmarks of inflammation, namely, pain, swelling, redness, and heat, are results of an adequate inflammatory response with the aim of bringing the affected tissue back to restitution (Latin: restitutio ad integrum). Cooling of the affected limb and anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used but may deter healing. The healing process is governed by fatty acids of the omega-3 and omega-6 series. In order to facilitate healing, these fatty acids have to be present in significant amounts in the affected tissues before the trauma occurs. This is particularly relevant for marine omega-3 fatty acids, which are often running low due to insignificant intake of seafood, common in individuals practicing sports. High-energy sports often lead to head and brain trauma. Continuous head traumata may even result in later mental defects. Saturation of brain cells with omega-3 fatty acids, in particular docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may facilitate healing after brain trauma, thereby counteracting negative long-term results.The present understanding of a normal inflammatory process leading to restitution will be discussed along with data from recent scientific trials.

Title:  parkinsonism; MPTP; caffeine; DPCPX; KW-6002        
Abstract: Introduction: In Parkinson's disease (PD), compelling data indicate a functional link between adenosine/dopamine receptors and the progression of the neurodegenerative process. The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of the non-selective adenosine receptor (ADR) antagonist caffeine, as well as the selective antagonists 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), an ADRsA(1) antagonist, and ((E)-1,3-diethyl-8-(3,4-dimethoxystyryl)-7-methyl-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione) (KW-6002), an ADRsA(2A) antagonist, on the prevention of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinsonism in mice. Material and methods: Mice were allocated to five groups: group I control group; group II: MPTP group, received four injections of MPTP (20 mg/kg, i.p.) at 2 h intervals; groups III, IV, V: received MPTP and i.p caffeine (20 mg/kg/day) or DPCPX (5 mg/kg/day) or KW-6002 (10 mg/kg/day) starting one week before MPTP injection and continuing for 2 weeks. Results: Therapy with caffeine or KW-6002 not only led to the reversibility of movement dysfunction and increased the concentrations of dopamine and ATP levels (p < 0.05), but also, ameliorates the dopaminergic neuron loss and restored the mtDNA and nDNA integrity (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in passive avoidance test, caffeine and DPCPX significantly (p < 0.05) reversed the MPTP-induced memory deficits, whereas the specific ADRsA2A antagonist did not. Conclusions: The current results provide evidence that blockade of both ADRsA(1) and ADRsA(2A) has therapeutic implications in alleviating MPTP-induced motor and cognitive dysfunction and might be a promising candidate for treatment of PD.

Abstract: The article presents functional schemes of two IPmodules included into a new (2016) radiation-hardened structured arrays (SA) MH2XA010. The microcircuits of the main modifications of op amps (OAs) with current negative feedback (CNF) can be realized on the base of SA (due to the interconnection wiring of elements). The terminal parameters of op amps are considered, the practical recommendations for choosing the steady-state behaviors, the active and passive elements of SA, providing the peak values of the slew rate and the upper frequency limit of op amp in a wide range of changes of transfer ratios are given. The properties of a new subclass of op amps based on SA MH2XA010 -circuits with the so called generalized current negative feedback, combining the properties of classical op amps with voltage feedback and op amps with CNF are examined.

Title:  CEO deaths; CEO effects; event study; managerial discretion; senior executives        
Abstract: Despite a number of studies highlighting the important impact Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) have on firms, several theoretical and methodological questions cloud existing findings. This study takes an alternative approach by examining how shareholders' perceptions of CEO significance have changed over time. Using an event study methodology and a sample of 240 sudden and unexpected CEO deaths, we show that absolute (unsigned) market reactions to these events in U.S. public firms have increased markedly between 1950 and 2009. Our results indicate that shareholders act in ways consistent with the belief that CEOs have become increasingly more influential in recent decades. Managerial summary: With Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) facing increased scrutiny and receiving ever-increasing pay packages, substantial debate exists about their overall contribution to firm outcomes. While prior research has sought to calculate the proportion of firm outcomes attributable to the CEO, this study takes an alternative approach by using the ""wisdom of the crowds"" to assess how shareholders think about the importance of CEOs. Our study finds that shareholders, perhaps the most financially motivated stakeholder, view CEOs as increasingly important drivers of firm outcomes, good and bad, versus their peers from decades earlier. Notably, market reaction to the unexpected death of a CEO has increased steadily over the last six decades, highlighting the importance of succession planning and supporting, at least partially, the increased compensation given today's top executives.

Title:  Senior Social Insurance; Health Function; System Coupling        
Abstract: With the rapid development of internet technology, the new methodologies and techniques based on data analysis are increasing popular for decision-making on many aspects of society and economy, including insurance system. The research focus on the current challenges faced by the senior insurance system of China, such as the acceleration of population aging, the rising prevalence rate of chronic diseases among aging population, and the increasing burden of the senior insurance system. This paper, based on the analysis of CLHLS data from Beijing University and other data sources, mainly investigated the relationship between the social insurance and the health level of the senior population through a multiple linear regression model from a Grossman health function. The preliminary conclusions can be drawn from the study as follows. Through the comparison of the regression coefficients, it is clear that the three kinds of basic medical care have different effects on the health level of senior population. The interpretation function of medical insurance on senior health level is lower than those of other social decisions and social support factors, while the influence of pension insurance is minor. Furthermore, the paper studied the coupling mechanism among pension, medical and nursing insurances, and put forward the suggestions of merging pension, medical and nursing insurances to one single plan to improve the efficiency performance of the current social security service system.

Title:  Software Engineering; Software Architecture; Quality Attributes; Stability; Understandability        
Abstract: Over the past years software architecture has become an important sub-field of software engineering. There has been substantial advancement in developing new technical approaches to start handling architectural design as an engineering discipline. Measurement is an essential part of any engineering discipline. Quantifying the quality attributes of the software architecture will reveal good insights about the architecture. It will also help architects and practioners to choose the best fit of alternative architectures that meets their needs. This work paves the way for researchers to start investigating ways to measure software architecture quality attributes. Measurement of these qualities is essential for this sub-field of software engineering. This work explores Stability and Understandability of software architecture, several metrics that affect them, and literature review of these qualities.

Title:  CEP; DBMS; SQL        
Abstract: Nowadays many applications must process events at a very high rate. These events are processed on the fly, without being stored. Complex Event Processing technology (CEP) is used to implement such applications. Some of the CEP systems, like Apache Storm the most popular CEPs, lack a query language and operators to program queries as done in traditional relational databases. This paper presents PaaS-CEP, a CEP language that provides a SQL-like language to program queries for CEP and its integration with data stores (database or key-value store). Our current implementation is done on top of Apache Storm however, the CEP language can be used with any CEP. The paper describes the architecture of the PaaS-CEP, its query language and the algebraic operators. The paper also details the integration of the CEP with traditional data stores that allows the correlation of live streaming data with the stored data.

Title:  Bivalves; Particle image velocimetry; Jet flow; Suction feeding; Micro pumps; Mussel filtration        
Abstract: Hydrodynamic performance of the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, is studied with time-resolved particle image velocimetry. We evaluated inhalant flow, exhalant jet flow, suction performance and flow control capabilities of the mussels quantitatively. Inhalant flow structures of mussels are measured at the coronal plane for the first time in literature. Nutrient fluid is convected into the mussel by three-dimensional sink flow. Inhalant velocity reaches its highest magnitude inside the mussel mantle while it is accelerating outward from the mussels. We calculated pressure gradient at the coronal plane. As inhalant flow approaches the mussel shell tip, suction force generated by the inhalant flow increases and becomes significant at the shell tip. Likewise, exhalant jet flow regimes were studied for 17 mussels. Mussels can control their exhalant jet flow structure from a single potential core region to double potential core region or vice versa. Peak exhalant jet velocity generated by the mussels changes between 2.77 cm s(-1) and 11.1 cm s(-1) as a function of mussel cavity volume. Measurements of hydrodynamic dissipation at the sagittal plane revealed no interaction between the inhalant and exhalant jet flow, indicating energy-efficient synchronized pumping mechanism. This efficient pumping mechanismis associated with the flow-turning angle between inhalant and exhalant jet flows, similar to 90 degrees (s.d. 12 degrees).

Title:  Distributed wind energy; Wind turbine gearbox; Variable speed operation; Aerodynamic efficiency        
Abstract: A Variable Ratio Gearbox (VRG) can be used in the drivetrain of a small to medium-size wind turbine to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Currently, all commercially-available wind turbines operate using a fixed-gear ratio between the turbine rotor and electrical generator. A VRG allows wind turbines, with a constant-speed generator, to discretely vary rotor speed and to achieve greater aerodynamic efficiency. The authors' previous results demonstrate the viability of the VRG design. This research quantifies the gain in efficiency for a VRG-enabled wind turbine based on wind data from representing all seven wind classifications. A method is also presented to identify turbine sites that provide the VRG with the greatest opportunities to increase production. The overall findings suggest that the VRG can benefit all wind turbines, irrespective of wind class, with some wind profiles in the study experiencing gains greater than 10%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title:  Lung cancer; PD-L1; PD-1; Pembrolizumab; EGFR; ALK        
Abstract: Introduction: Targeted somatic genomic analysis (EGFR, anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene [ALK], and ROS1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) are used for selection of first-line therapies in advanced lung cancer; however, the frequency of overlap of these biomarkers in routine clinical practice is poorly reported. Methods: We retrospectively probed the first 71 pairs of patients with lung adenocarcinoma from our institution. They were analyzed for PD-L1 by IHC using the clone 22C3 pharmDx kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and evaluated for co-occurrence of genomic aberrations and clinicopathologic characteristics. Results: Surgical resection specimens, small biopsy (transbronchial or core needle) samples, and cytologic cell blocks (needle aspirates or pleural fluid) were tested. A PD-L1 TPS of at least >= 50% was seen in 29.6% of tumors. Of 19 tumors with EGFR mutations, ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization positivity, or ROS1 fluorescence in situ hybridization positivity, 18 had a PD-L1 TPS less than 50% versus only one tumor with a PD-L1 TPS of at least 50% (p = 0.0073). Tumors with a PD-L1 TPS of at least 50% were significantly associated with smoking status compared with tumors with a PD-L1 TPS less than 50% but were not associated with patient sex, ethnicity, tumor stage, biopsy site, or biopsy type/preparation. Conclusions: PD-L1 IHC can be performed on routine clinical lung cancer specimens. A TPS of at least 50% seldom overlaps with presence of driver oncogenes with approved targeted therapies. Three biomarker-specified groups of advanced lung adenocarcinomas can now be defined, each paired with a specific palliative first-line systemic therapy of proven clinical benefit: (1) EGFR/ALK/ROS1-affected adenocarcinoma paired with a matched tyrosine kinase inhibitor (similar to 20% of cases), (2) PD-L1-enriched adenocarcinoma (TPS >= 50%) paired with anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab (similar to 30% of cases), and (3) biomarker-negative (i.e., EGFR/ALK/ROS1/PD-L1-negative) adenocarcinoma paired with platinum doublet chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (similar to 50% of cases).

Title:  Fracking; energy; government subsidies; property rights violations        
Abstract: Like most other things, fracking has its good and bad points. In the former regard, it is a technological breakthrough that can increase the supplies of energy of the entire economy. In the latter, it has been linked with an increased incidence of earthquakes and water pollution, surely negatives. As well, there is some evidence fracking would not exist, at least not to the present extent, were it not for government subsidies, which, we argue, misallocate resources.

Title:  Bifidobacterium; brain gut axis; GABA; microbiome; neuromodulation        
Abstract: BackgroundRecurrent abdominal pain is a common and costly health-care problem attributed, in part, to visceral hypersensitivity. Increasing evidence suggests that gut bacteria contribute to abdominal pain perception by modulating the microbiome-gut-brain axis. However, specific microbial signals remain poorly defined. -aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter and a key regulator of abdominal and central pain perception from peripheral afferent neurons. Although gut bacteria are reported to produce GABA, it is not known whether the microbial-derived neurotransmitter modulates abdominal pain. MethodsTo investigate the potential analgesic effects of microbial GABA, we performed daily oral administration of a specific Bifidobacterium strain (B.dentiumATCC 27678) in a rat fecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity, and subsequently evaluated pain responses. Key ResultsWe demonstrate that commensal Bifidobacterium dentium produces GABA via enzymatic decarboxylation of glutamate by GadB. Daily oral administration of this specific Bifidobacterium (but not a gadB deficient) strain modulated sensory neuron activity in a rat fecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity. Conclusions & InferencesThe functional significance of microbial-derived GABA was demonstrated by gadB-dependent desensitization of colonic afferents in a murine model of visceral hypersensitivity. Visceral pain modulation represents another potential health benefit attributed to bifidobacteria and other GABA-producing species of the intestinal microbiome. Targeting GABAergic signals along this microbiome-gut-brain axis represents a new approach for the treatment of abdominal pain.

Abstract: Foetal breathing in mice results from prenatal activity of the two coupled hindbrain oscillators considered to be responsible for respiratory rhythm generation after birth: the pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC) is active shortly before the onset of foetal breathing; the parafacial respiratory group (e-pF in embryo) starts activity one day earlier. Transcription factors have been identified that are essential to specify neural progenitors and lineages forming each of these oscillators during early development of the neural tube: Hoxa1, Egr2 (Krox20), Phox2b, Lbx1 and Atoh1 for the e-pF; Dbx1 and Evx1 for the preBotC which eventually grow contralateral axons requiring expression of Robo3. Inactivation of the genes encoding these factors leads to mis-specification of these neurons and distinct breathing abnormalities: apneic patterns and loss of central chemosensitivity for the e-pF (central congenital hypoventilation syndrome. CCHS, in humans), complete loss of breathing for the preBotC, right-left desynchronized breathing in Robo3 mutants. Mutations affecting development in more rostral (pontine) respiratory territories change the shape of the inspiratory drive without affecting the rhythm. Other (primordial) embryonic oscillators start in the mouse three days before the e-pF, to generate low frequency (LF) rhythms that are probably required for activity-dependent development of neurones at embryonic stages; in the foetus, however, they are actively silenced to avoid detrimental interaction with the on-going respiratory rhythm. Altogether, these observations provide a strong support to the previously proposed hypothesis that the functional organization of the respiratory generator is specified at early stages of development and is dual in nature, comprising two serially non-homologous oscillators.

Title:  Levonorgestrel; Early-life stage; mRNA expression; Fathead minnow        
Abstract: Pharmaceuticals are routinely detected in the environment; and several of these compounds have been extensively researched due to their potential impacts to the endocrine system of aquatic organisms. The negative reproductive consequences of synthetic progestins in teleost species have only recently been investigated. The current study examined different exposure periods that may be most sensitive for levonorgestrel (LNG) in early-life stages of fathead minnow larvae. Larvae were exposed to a single concentration of LNG (125 ng/L) for different durations from fertilized egg through 28 days post hatch (dph) with growth and mRNA expression of FSH, 3 beta-HSD, 20 beta-HSD, and CYP19a1 measured. Regardless of the duration of exposure, LNG significantly decreased growth in the fathead minnow larvae at day 28. For both 20 beta-HSD and CYP19a1, mRNA expression was decreased following LNG exposure durations >= 7 days. 3 beta-HSD and FSH showed similar trends after exposure to LNG with later stages of development exhibiting decreased expression. 20 beta-HSD and 3 beta-HSD were the only transcripts to remain down regulated once larvae were moved to clean water after the 7-14 dph LNG exposure. This study is the first to investigate the effects of exposure time to a synthetic progestin on developing fish. Future research is needed to understand what impacts these changes have on adult stages of development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Allogenic lymphocyte immunotherapy; effectiveness; meta-analysis; timing of treatment; unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion        
Abstract: Allogenic lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) as a treatment for unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) is still controversial due to the lack of enough controls to evaluate its effectiveness. Eighteen randomized, placebo-controlled trials with LIT for URSA were included in the meta-analysis. Live birth rates for each group were extracted, and the overall odds ratio (OR) for LIT was calculated. The success rate of treatment group was significantly higher (OR 3.74, 95% CI 3.07 similar to 4.57). LIT performed before and during pregnancy had dramatically improved the live birth rate in women with URSA (OR 4.67, 95% CI 3.70 similar to 5.90). The overall OR was 5.25 (95% CI 4.16 similar to 6.64), which supports a low dose of lymphocytes for treating URSA. Our results indicate that LIT provides a significantly beneficial effect over placebo for URSA. LIT given before and during pregnancy is superior to LIT given only before pregnancy, and the lower doses per treatment (less than 100 x 10(6) lymphocytes or 100 mL peripheral blood) achieved a better outcome.

Title:  NoSQL; Deduplication; Hadoop; MapReduce; HDFS; HBase; MongoDB; Hive; Pig        
Abstract: The burgeoning volume of torrential data continues to grow exponentially in this very age of the Internet of Things. As this torrent of digital datasets continue to outgrow in datacenters, the focus needs to be shifted to stored data reduction methods and that too pertaining to NoSQL databases as traditional structured storage systems continuously tend to face challenges in providing the required storage, throughputs and computational power requirements necessary to capture, store, manage and analyze the deluge of data. Deduplication systems, thus designed, retain a single copy of redundant data on disk to save disk space, but what if we want to keep certain copies intentionally and need wishful elimination. This paper leverages Hadoop framework to design and develop a duplication detection system that detects multiple copies of the same data right at the file level itself and that too before transmission. Thereafter, various datasets are tuned for better performance and analysed using MapReduce, Hive and Pig.

Title:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; Lung cancer; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Palliative care        
Abstract: The issue of intensive and palliative care in patients with chronic disease frequently arises. This review aims to describe the prognostic factors of chronic respiratory diseases instable and in acute situations in order to improve the management of these complex situations. The various laws on patients' rights provide a legal framework and define the concept of unreasonable obstinacy. For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the most robust decision factors are good knowledge of the respiratory disease, the comorbidities, the history of previous exacerbations and patient preferences. In the case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, it is necessary to know if there is a prospect of transplantation and to assess the reversibility of the respiratory distress. In the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, treatment decisions depend on the presence of advance directives about the use of intubation and tracheostomy. For lung cancer patients, general condition, cancer history and the tumor treatment plan are important factors. A multidisciplinary discussion that takes into account the patient's medical history, wishes and the current state of knowledge permits the taking of a coherent decision. (C) 2016 SPLF.

Title:  DBT; dialectical behaviour therapy; intellectual disabilities; learning disabilities; personal construct psychology; repertory grid        
Abstract: Background: Government strategy indicates that individuals with learning disabilities should have access to adapted psychological therapies. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is recommended for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, there is little published research regarding whether it can be appropriately adapted for adults with learning disabilities. The research available primarily focuses on measures of behavioural and psychiatric change, with little emphasis on the psychological changes that occur. Materials and Methods: Two case studies are presented that using repertory grid technique, based on personal construct psychology (PCP). Both individuals completed repertory grids prior to, and following, adapted DBT for adults with learning disabilities within a specialist community psychology service in the United Kingdom. Results: The case studies show some of the psychological changes that have occurred within adults with learning disabilities who received adapted DBT within a community psychology service. Changes included altered self-esteem and dilemmas individuals have about themselves. Conclusion: The contrasting case studies demonstrate the complexity and idiosyncrasy of the experiences of individuals with learning disabilities who receive DBT, and discuss how this information can be integrated into clinical practice.

Title:  brainstem; diffusion MRI; limbic system; probabilistic tractography; spinal cord        
Abstract: The limbic system has a central role for the integration of several cognitive and visceral functions through an extended network of connections involving the hippocampus and the amygdala. A number of studies performed in humans have been dedicated to the investigation of supratentorial limbic pathways by means of non-invasive MRI approaches, such as DTI. However, detection of possible limbic connections involving the brainstem and the spinal cord is still missing. Subtentorial limbic pathways have been previously studied in animals by means of invasive approaches, including viral tracing. The detection of limbic connections with the brainstem and the spinal cord has raised several new hypotheses regarding the interaction between the central nervous system and the periphery of the body. We investigated subtentorial limbic connections in twenty-one healthy humans by means of probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution tractography. Our connectivity analysis showed, for both the hippocampus and the amygdala, a high probability of connections with the midbrain, pons, and bulb. Moreover, hippocampal and amygdalar pathways reaching the cervical spinal cord were also detected. Quantitative evaluation of diffusion parameters was also performed. Findings of the present study are in agreement with the literature and provide the first report of possible limbic connections between the brain stem and the spinal cord in human brain. Since these pathways might also have important implications both in physiological and pathological contexts, further studies should be conducted in order to confirm our data as well as to define functional features of these brain connections.

Title:  criminological theory; information society; social harm; video games; pornography        
Abstract: New media formats and technologies raise questions about new-found abilities to indulge apparently limitless violent and sadistic curiosity within our culture. In this context, the mainstreaming of sex and violence via mobile and screen media systems opens important questions about the degree to which these influences are harmful or indicative of deeper social problems. In this article, we offer a preliminary analysis of the consequences of these new media zones, acknowledging their allure, excitement and everyday cultural position. In particular, we focus on a distinctive hallmark of much online pornography and massively popular violent video games-the offer of unchecked encounters with others who can be subordinated to violent and sexual desire. We suggest that a key implication of these zones of cultural exception, in which social rules can be more or less abandoned, is their role in further assisting denials of harm from the perspective of hyper-masculinist and militaristic social value systems.

Title:  Flexibility; Scaling; FRF magnitude; Output-only; Modal identification        
Abstract: The magnitudes of the frequency response functions (FRFs) from ambient vibrations are seldom to be investigated because they are not necessary for basic modal parameter (frequency, damping and mode shape) identification. However, they are necessary for structural flexibility identification. In this article, the FRF magnitudes from output-only data are investigated, and an approach to identify structural un-scaled flexibility characteristics is proposed. It first quantitatively formulates the relation between the magnitudes of the FRFs estimated from the vibration test data with known/unknown input forces. It is proved that the magnitude ratios between the above two kinds of FRFs are mode-dependent. Then, a way to calculate the magnitude ratios is proposed to scale the FRFs from output-only data. Finally, the closed-form solution of the un-scaled flexibility is derived from ambient vibration data. The identified un-scaled flexibility will reveal the load-deflection characteristics of a structure to further engineers' under-standing about the structure's safety condition. Numerical and experimental examples illustrate the effectiveness of the un-scaled flexibility identification theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Completed in 2013, the Hardanger Bridge is now the longest suspension bridge in Norway and it is among the most slender suspension bridges in the world. In the context of an extensive research project initiated by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the bridge was installed with a comprehensive monitoring system to investigate the wind characteristics at the site along with the dynamic response of the bridge. Wind velocities are measured using nine anemometers installed on different locations at the bridge span. A representative 10 min recording with high mean wind velocity and perpendicular wind direction is selected to present the preliminary results. Time series of turbulence components and one-point spectra are presented. Spatial properties of the wind field are studied by examining the coherences of turbulence components for several separation distances. Dynamic response of the bridge is measured using 20 accelerometers distributed along the main span. Time histories of the accelerations as well as the response spectra are presented. The relationship between bridge vibrations and wind measurements is discussed.

Title:  Optical devices; optical sound recording; optical sound synthesis; optical sound processing; nonlinear optical elements        
Abstract: This contribution provides an overview of optical techniques for sound recording, sound synthesis, and sound processing. Several applications of optical devices, examples, and references describing the history and current trends in this field will be given. For sound recording, optical devices can be used to capture vibrations and to transform mechanical sound waves into an electrical signal. Optical storage of audio has a long history beginning with analog sound tracks on film up to recent optical media as for example the Blue-ray Disc. For sound synthesis based on optical systems we will give examples based on graphical sound and the photo-sonic disc for time-domain synthesis. Frequency-domain synthesis techniques which are controlled by a time-frequency (image domain) signal representation will be explained. For analog sound processing the use of a light emitting diode coupled to a photo-electric cell (light dependent resistor) constitutes a nonlinear two-port electrical network or element. These optocouplers have still a wide range of applications for switching, gating, and volume control of audio signals due to their special nonlinear behavior. Hence, there exists a broad interest for high-quality discrete-time models of these devices. An overview of several applications with these optical nonlinearities will be given.

Title:  Brain imaging; intrinsic optical imaging; spreading depression; acute stroke; animal models        
Abstract: Haemodynamic responses to spreading depolarizations (SDs) have an important role during the development of secondary brain damage. Characterization of the haemodynamic responses in larger brains, however, is difficult due to movement artefacts. Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging, laser speckle flowmetry (LSF) and electrocorticography were performed in different configurations in three groups of in total 18 swine. SDs were elicited by topical application of KCl or occurred spontaneously after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Movement artefacts in IOS were compensated by an elastic registration algorithm during post-processing. Using movement-compensated IOS, we were able to differentiate between four components of optical changes, corresponding closely with haemodynamic variations measured by LSF. Compared with ECoG and LSF, our setup provides higher spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a better signal-to-noise ratio. Using IOS alone, we could identify the different zones of infarction in a large gyrencephalic middle cerebral artery occlusion pig model. We strongly suggest movement-compensated IOS for the investigation of the role of haemodynamic responses to SDs during the development of secondary brain damage and in particular to examine the effect of potential therapeutic interventions in gyrencephalic brains.

Title:  fungal infection; pseudofungi; Gamna-Gandy bodies        
Abstract: Pseudofungi are septate hyphae-like structures very similar morphologically to true fungal elements. Histologically their presence poses a diagnostic challenge as they mimic fungal infection. Accurate identification of pseudofungi is required to avoid unnecessary treatment, and this can be accomplished by careful morphologic analysis with the use of appropriate histochemical stains. We report a patient with pseudofungi within a paratracheal lymph node, describe the morphologic findings, and discuss the differential diagnosis.

Title:  Ankylosing spondylitis; Annexin A2; Ossification; IL-6        
Abstract: Background: Annexin A2, a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein, is involved in osteogenesis. The objective of the present study was to explore the expression of Annexin A2 in spinal ligament tissues (LT) of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients and determine its pathological functions. Methods: mRNA and protein expression of Annexin A2 was detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration in serum was assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured with ALP activity kit on a microplate reader. Results: mRNA and protein expression of Annexin A2 in LT, and IL-6 concentration in serum were significantly increased in AS patients. Moreover, exogenous IL-6 treatment significantly up-regulated Annexin A2 expression and ALP activity. Silencing of Annexin A2 expression significantly ameliorated IL-6-induced ossification of fibroblasts from AS patients, as indicated by ALP activity, expression of proteins associated with osteogenic differentiation, including bone morphogenetic protein-2, osteocalcin and osterix, and the ratio of osteoprotegerin to receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand. Further MEK inhibitor experiments suggested that Annexin A2 may exert its function through extracellular signal-related kinase pathway. Conclusions: Annexin A2, up-regulated by IL-6, may promote ligament ossification of AS patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the clinical correlates of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) among 158 inpatient youths with two types of severe psychiatric disorders. ACEs were retrospectively collected with the ACEs scale and the List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire in 77 patients hospitalized for a catatonic syndrome (average age 15.2 years) and 81 for a manic or mixed episode (average age 15.7 years). ACEs were frequent in youths suffering from bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) (58 %) and from catatonia (57 %), with around one quarter exposed to severe abuse (i.e., physical/sexual/emotional abuse or physical/emotional neglect). Youths with BD-I were more likely to be exposed to family violence compared to those with catatonia. Youths who had been exposed to ACEs did not exhibit a more severe presentation or a poorer response to treatment compared to others, either in the bipolar group or in the catatonic group.

Title:  hereditary hemochromatosis; HFE p; C282Y homozygosity; iron accumulation; iron overload-related disease; menopause; women's health        
Abstract: Background and Aim: Women who are homozygous for the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene are at much lower risk of iron overload-related disease than p.C282Y homozygous men, presumably because of the iron-depleting effects of menstruation and pregnancy. We used data from a population cohort study to model the impact of menstruation cessation at menopause on serum ferritin (SF) levels in female p.C282Y homozygotes, with p.C282Y/p.H63D simple or compound heterozygotes and those with neither p.C282Y nor p.H63D mutations (HFE wild types) as comparison groups. Methods: A sample of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study was selected for the ""HealthIron"" study (n=1438) including all HFE p.C282Y homozygotes plus a random sample stratified by HFE-genotype (p.C282Y and p.H63D). The relationship between the natural logarithm of SF and time since menopause was examined using linear mixed models incorporating spline smoothing. Results: For p.C282Y homozygotes, SF increased by a factor of 3.6 (95% CI (1.8, 7.0), P<0.001) during the first 10 years postmenopause, after which SF continued to increase but at less than half the previous rate. In contrast, SF profiles for other HFE genotype groups increase more gradually and did not show a distinction between premenopausal and postmenopausal SF levels. Only p.C282Y homozygotes had predicted SF exceeding 200 mu g/L postmenopause, but the projected SF did not increase the risk of iron overload-related disease. Conclusions: These data provide the first documented evidence that physiological blood loss is a major factor in determining the marked gender difference in expression of p.C282Y homozygosity.

Title:  Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia; Migraine; Neurostimulation; Vagal nerve stimulation; Supraorbital nerve stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation        
Abstract: Purpose of Review There is growing interest in neuromodulation for primary headache conditions. Invasive modalities such as occipital nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation are reserved for the most severe and intractable patients. Non-invasive options such as vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS), supraorbital nerve stimulation (nSONS) and transcranial magnetic nerve stimulation (TMS) have all emerged as potentially useful headache treatments. This review examines the evidence base for non-invasive neuromodulation in trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and migraine. Recent Findings Although a number of open-label series of non-invasive neuromodulation devices have been published, there is very little controlled evidence for their use in any headache condition. Open-label evidence suggests that nVNS may have a role in the prophylactic treatment of cluster headache and there is limited evidence to suggest it may be useful in the acute treatment of cluster and potentially migraine attacks. There is limited controlled evidence to suggest a role for nSONS in the prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine but there is no evidence to support its use in cluster headache. TMS may be efficacious in the acute treatment of episodic migraine has no controlled evidence to support its use as a preventative in any headache condition. Summary Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques are an attractive treatment option with excellent safety profiles but their use is not yet supported by high-quality randomised controlled trials.

Title:  Nanoparticles; Semiconductors; Solar energy materials        
Abstract: Metal selenides have been proposed as counter electrodes (CEs) to substitute for Pt in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to their good catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide. In this paper, NiSe2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile, room-temperature process and used as the CEs. In order to further enhance the photovoltaic property, graphene was introduced by facile physical mixing. Eventually, with the assistance of graphene, NiSe2 + 6 wt% graphene CE exhibited better power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared with Pt CE. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Micafungin; Fluconazole; Invasive fungal infection; Prophylaxis; Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation        
Abstract: Objectives: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) cause significant morbidity and mortality among recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although fluconazole is used widely as an antifungal prophylactic agent in these patients, it is not reliably effective against mold infection including invasive aspergillosis. Micafungin provides antifungal activity against Candida and Aspergillus species, and previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy when used as a prophylactic agent for fungal infection in neutropenic patients. Here, we evaluated and compared the incidence of proven or probable IFIs after antifungal prophylaxis using micafungin or fluconazole. Methods: This was a prospective, single-center, phase II study involving adult patients who received allogeneic or autologous HSCT. Patients were randomly assigned to micafungin or fluconazole arms in a ratio of 2: 1, and the treatment was initiated within 24 h of HSCT and maintained for up to 21 days. The primary end point was the incidence of proven or probable IFIs during the 100 days after HSCT. The secondary end points were the incidence rates of possible, proven, or probable IFIs, need to change the antifungal agent before engraftment, IFI-related mortality, and survival within 100 days after transplantation. Results: Between March 2010 and May 2015, a total of 257 patients were enrolled. After exclusion of seven patients who did not receive at least one dose of a study treatment, 250 patients (micafungin, n = 165; fluconazole, n = 85) were included in the analysis of clinical efficacy. The median age was 47 years (range, 20-64). Allogeneic and autologous transplantations were performed in 56.0% (n = 140) and 44.0% (n = 110) of the patients, respectively. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. Overall, the incidence of proven and probable IFIs within 100 days of HSCT was 7.6% (n = 19). The percentages of patients who experienced proven or probable IFIs did not differ significantly between the micafungin and fluconazole groups: 7.3% and 8.2%, respectively (p = 0.786). Thirteen patients in the micafungin arm (7.9%) and eight patients in the fluconazole arm (9.4%) needed a change in antifungal agent before engraftment (p = 0.824). Mortality within 100 days after HSCT did not differ significantly between groups: 9.1% vs 12.9% in the micafungin and fluconazole arms, respectively (p = 0.345). Conclusion: Micafungin is comparable to fluconazole for the prevention of IFIs in HSCT recipients. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The British Infection Association.

Title:  Spondyloarthritis; computed tomography (CT); sacroiliitis; sacroiliac joints; low back pain; skeletal-axial        
Abstract: Background: Computed tomography (CT) examinations of the lumbar spine are commonly performed in patients aged <= 40 years due to low back pain (LBP). Purpose: To investigate the prevalence and awareness of radiologists for the presence of structural post-inflammatory/other sacroiliac joint (SIJ) alterations on lumbar spine CTs of young patients with LBP. Material and Methods: A total of 484 lumbar spine CTexaminations (272 men, 212 women; average age, 31 years; age range, 18-40 years) of patients with LBP in which the entire SIJs were visualized were retrospectively reviewed. SIJs were scored (consensus) by two senior radiologists (study reading) for the presence of post-inflammatory structural SIJ findings or other SIJs alterations. The original reports were compared to the study reading. Fifty CT examinations were re-evaluated for reliability assessment (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC]). Results: A total of 150 (31%) abnormal SIJ examinations were registered (ICC: r = 0.7-0.8; P < 0.0001): suspected sacroiliitis = 50 (10.2%); definite sacroiliitis = 16 (3.3%); osteitis-condensans-ilii = 38 (7.8%); diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis = 24 (5%); degenerative changes = 22 (4.5%); accessory SIJ = 22 (4.5%); and tumor = 1. The SIJs were referenced 39 times (8.0%) in the original readings: pathological findings (n = 15); and normal SIJ (n = 24). Total diagnostic accuracy for these reports only and for the entire readings were 49% and 69%, respectively, and 13% and 1.3%, respectively, for the pathological findings. Conclusion: Sacroiliitis and other SIJ alterations are prevalent in young individuals with LBP, albeit, the majority of these alterations are not recognized nor reported by senior radiologists thus may delay efficacious treatment.

Title:  Loss of response; Anti-TNF alpha; Dose intensification; Crohn's disease        
Abstract: To review the frequency with which anti-TNF-alpha loses its effect and dose ""intensification"" is required for Crohn's disease (CD) treatment. Electronic databases were searched for eligible studies. Raw data from studies meeting inclusion criteria were pooled for effect estimates. Subgroup analyses were performed for exploration of heterogeneity regarding all outcomes. Eighty-six eligible studies were included. Estimates of loss of response (LOR) incidence ranged from 8 to 71%. The random effects pooled incidence of LOR with a median follow-up of 1-year was 33% (95% CI 29-38, 55 studies, n = 6135). The effect estimate based on data from patients with infliximab was 33% (95% CI 27-40), 30% (95% CI 22-39) for adalimumab, and 41% (95% CI 30-53) for certolizumabpegol. Overall, the mean percentage of patients' LOR to anti-TNFs was 38.5%. The annual risk for LOR was 20.9% per patient-year. The random-effects pooled rate of need for dose intensification with a median follow-up of 1 year was 34% (95% CI 28-41, 38 studies, n = 10,690). The effect estimate for infliximab was 38% (95% CI 28-50), 36% (95% CI 30-43) for adalimumab, and 2% (95% CI 2-3) for certolizumab-pegol. The mean percentage of patients who needed an anti-TNF dose escalation was 23% with an annual risk of 18.5% per patient-year. There was no evidence of publication bias for incidence of LOR but not for the dose intensification (p = 0.001). Overall, around one-third of CD patients experience a LOR and required dose intensification in primary anti-TNF-alpha responders.

Title:  headache; migraine; hypothyroidism        
Abstract: ObjectiveTo determine whether headache disorders are a risk factor for the development of new onset hypothyroidism. BackgroundPast studies have reported associations between headache disorders and hypothyroidism, but the directionality of the association is unknown. MethodsThis was a longitudinal retrospective cohort study using data from the Fernald Medical Monitoring Program (FMMP). Residents received physical examinations and thyroid function testing every 3 years during the 20 year program. Residents were excluded from the cohort if there was evidence of past thyroid disease or abnormal thyroid function tests at the first office visit. A diagnosis of a headache disorder was established by self-report of frequent headaches, use of any headache-specific medication, or a physician diagnosis of a headache disorder. The primary outcome measure was new onset hypothyroidism defined as the initiation of thyroid replacement therapy or TSH 10 without thyroid medication. A Cox survival analysis with time dependent variables were used for the model. Headache disorders, age, sex, body mass index, income, smoking, narcotic use, and hypothyroidism-producing medications were independent variables in the model. ResultsData from 8412 residents enrolled in the FMMP were used in the current study. Headache disorders were present in about 26% of the residents and new onset hypothyroidism developed in approximate to 7%. The hazard ratio for the development of new onset hypothyroidism was 1.21 (95% CI=1.001, 1.462) for those with headache disorders. ConclusionsHeadache disorders may be associated with an increased risk for the development of new onset hypothyroidism.

Abstract: Three dimensional printing (3D printing) or additive manufacturing is a promising approach for construction of small-sized, complex structures in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This paper reports the design, fabrication and testing of an XY nanopositioning flexure made up of Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) created for the first time through electron beam melting (EBM), also known as electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM). Titanium alloys present attractive characteristics including high biocompatibility, distinct strength and corrosion resistance. However, it has been difficult to machine titanium alloys through conventional processes. The use of additive manufacturing has enabled us to build a multidimensional nanopositioning flexure with amplified mechanical displacement and improved bandwidth contained in a compact structure. We first characterized mechanical properties of EBM-printed Ti-6Al-4V cantilevers and compared the results with those of bulk metal cantilevers. Due to the porous surfaces, the printed cantilevers acted as a softer material with an averaged Young's modulus of 41 GPa when considering only the outermost dimensions. By introducing inner widths of 0.51-0.53 mm for the CAD-designed beam width of 0.7 mm, we calculated a Young's modulus of 90-120 GPa, which is comparable to 108-120 GPa reported in literature for bulk Ti-6Al-4V. With the completion of the initial characterization, fabrication of the flexure was then undergone and successfully carried out. Mechanical levers printed within the flexure amplified an actuation from a piezoelectric actuator by a factor of six to displace a positioning platform supported by the network of parallel supporting beams. The maximum displacement of 47.4 mu m was obtained at the driving voltage of 150 V. The resonant frequencies measured for the x and y axes were almost identical 1854 Hz and 1858 Hz, respectively. A digital PID controller enabled laser-based dynamic positioning of the stage. For triangular sweeps at 16 Hz and 122 Hz, the positioning error was within 200 nm and 500 nm with time delays of 0.85 ms and 2.48 ms, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Human Papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) causes 70% of invasive cervical cancers (ICC) worldwide. Interaction between HPV16 genetic diversity, host genetics and target tissue largely determine the chances to trigger carcinogenesis. We have analyzed the differential prevalence of viral variants in 233 HPV16-monoinfected squamous (SCC), glandular (ADC) and mixed (ADSC) ICCs from four continents, assessing the contribution of geographical origin and cancer histology. We have further quantified the contribution of viral variants and cancer histology to differences in age at tumor diagnosis. The model fitted to the data explained 97% of the total variance: the largest explanatory factors were differential abundance among HPV16 variants (78%) and their interaction with cancer histology (9.2%) and geography (10.1%). HPV16_A1-3 variants were more prevalent in SCC while HPV16_D variants were increased in glandular ICCs. We confirm further a non-random geographical structure of the viral variants distribution. ADCs were diagnosed at younger ages than SCCs, independently of the viral variant triggering carcinogenesis. HPV16 variants are differentially associated with histological ICCs types, and ADCs are systematically diagnosed in younger women. Our results have implications for the implementation of cervical cancer screening algorithms, to ensure proper early detection of elusive ADCs.

Title:  Marrow fat; Osteoarthritis; Osteoporosis; Water/fat MRI        
Abstract: Objective: To assess the differential features of marrow adiposity between osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP) in postmenopausal women using water/fat MRI. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 97 postmenopausal women (OA [n = 25], OA + osteopenia [n = 27], OA + OP [n = 23], and OP groups [n = 22]). Water/fat MRI, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and biochemical analysis were performed to assess vertebral marrow fat fraction, bone mineral density, and bone biomarkers, respectively. Harris Hip Score was recorded to evaluate hip function. Results: There were significant differences in marrow fat content among the OA, OA + osteopenia, and OA + OP groups, between OP and OA participants with normal bone mass or osteopenia (all P < 0.05); no significant difference was observed between OA + OP and OP groups. Serum levels of leptin and beta-Crosslaps in OA with normal bone mass and osteopenic OA groups were higher than in OP group. Marrow fat fraction was inversely correlated with Harris Hip Score (r = -0.371, P = 0.013), bone mineral density (r = -0.554, P = 0.009) and leptin levels (r = -0.610, P < 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, marrow fat fraction was found to have a consistent and unchanged inverse association with leptin levels (S beta = -0.311, P = 0.002) and bone mineral density (S beta = -0.265, P = 0.006) after adjusting for age, years since menopause, and body mass index. Conclusions: Postmenopausal OA with OP have a phenotype with higher marrow adiposity. OA and OP could coexist, for the presence of a specific subgroup of OA with increased marrow fat accumulation and high risk of developing OP.

Title:  Sleep health; sleep education; sleep practices        
Abstract: Study Objectives: To examine sleep health knowledge and beliefs and their relationship to sleep practices in a community sample of caregivers of young children. Methods: A convenience sample of caregivers visiting a museum on one of 2 consecutive weekend days completed a brief parent-report survey on child sleep habits and parental basic sleep knowledge and beliefs and attitudes regarding sleep as a health behavior. Results: Of the 253 analyzable surveys (response rate 80%; mean age of index child 3.4 +/- 2.0 years), 23% of children did not have a consistent bedtime, 25% had a bedtime later than 9 pm, 23% had at least one electronic device in the bedroom, and 56% frequently fell asleep with an adult present. Both positive and negative sleep habits tended to cluster together. Children who had irregular and late bedtimes were more than twice as likely to obtain insufficient sleep that those with regular and early bedtimes (OR 2.30, 2.45). While 25% of children were getting less than the recommended sleep amount for age, just 13% of parents believed that their child was getting insufficient sleep. Lack of knowledge regarding the potential negative impact of specific sleep practices was associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in those practices. Conclusions: The results of this survey study of a generally well-educated sample of caregivers suggest that there are clear parental knowledge gaps regarding healthy sleep in young children and supports the need for increased sleep health education.

Title:  advanced paternal age; social development; autism; schizophrenia; neurodevelopment        
Abstract: Objective: Advanced paternal age (APA) at conception has been linked with autism and schizophrenia in offspring, neurodevelopmental disorders that affect social functioning. The current study explored the effects of paternal age on social development in the general population. Method: We used multilevel growth modeling to investigate APA effects on socioemotional development from early childhood until adolescence, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) sample. We also investigated genetic and environmental underpinnings of the paternal age effects on development, using the Additive genetics, Common environment, unique Environment (ACE) and gene environment (GxE) models. Results: In the general population, both very young and advanced paternal ages were associated with altered trajectory of social development (intercept: p = .01; slope: p = .03). No other behavioral domain was affected by either young or advanced age at fatherhood, suggesting specificity of paternal age effects. Increased importance of genetic factors in social development was recorded in the offspring of older but not very young fathers, suggesting distinct underpinnings of the paternal age effects at these two extremes. Conclusion: Our findings highlight that the APA-related deficits that lead to autism and schizophrenia are likely continuously distributed in the population.

Title:  aging; epidemiology; nocturia; older adults; sleep        
Abstract: Purpose: Nocturia is associated with poor sleep quality; however, little is known about the relationship between nocturia and sleep quality across different workforce-relevant age groups of adults. This has implications for developing new treatment strategies that are well tolerated across populations. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving merged data from the 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants responded to validated questions on nocturia frequency and sleep from the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire General Productivity subscale (FOSQ-gp, range 1-4). Analyses included multivariable linear regression with stratification by gender to examine associations between nocturia frequency (higher worse) and the FOSQ-gp scores (lower scores indicating worse daytime function related to sleep disturbance). Findings: Of 10,512 adults aged-2.0 years who completed the survey, 9148 (87%) had complete nocturia and FOSQ-gp data. The population age-adjusted prevalence of nocturia at least twice nightly was 21.1% among men and 26.6% among women (P < 0.001), and nocturia increased with age (P65 years) with greater nocturia frequency reported worse FOSQ-gp scores compared with younger adults with similar nocturia frequency (P < 0.001 among men and women). Implications: In a population-based sample of community-dwelling men and women, the association between nocturia and worsened functional outcomes of sleep was greater among adults older than 65 years a group more vulnerable to drug side effects, and in whom nocturia is typically multifactorial. Additionally, these analyses found that the association between nocturia and functional outcomes of sleep is stronger with increasing age among men. Effective treatment strategies that are well tolerated by older adults, such as multicomponent treatments that simultaneously address the combined effects of lower urinary tract and sleep dysfunction, are needed.

Title:  Direct injection; Spark ignition engine; Smart device; Neuro-fuzzy control; Green technology        
Abstract: Engine gas exchange processes are characterized by overall parameters. The volumetric efficiency is the most important of these parameters, and depends, in addition to fuel and operating variables, on the design of manifolds, valves and the ports of the engine. Moreover, the gas dynamics of the flowing gases including the pressure waves and the boundary layer thickness of the flow due to friction play an important role. A smart device is fitted to the exhaust pipe and used to improve the engine volumetric efficiency, power and fuel economy. This controlling valve takes its commands, depending on engine loading conditions, from signals of some sensors such as manifold air pressure, engine speed, air mass flow, and inlet air temperature. Hence, a suitable amount of air and fuel flow, achieves optimum performance conditions. Furthermore, this work was also intended to develop a neuro-fuzzy controller model for improving the performance of the spark-ignition engine (SIE) fitted with smart device. Experiments were carried out on a 4-cylinder, 1.8 L displacement volume, Mitsubishi engine using PID Controller. Full range of road-load test conditions were covered. A hydraulic dynamometer was used, in addition to a scan tool and exhaust gas analyzer. The obtained results show that using the smart device improves power by 3-21% and bsfc by 9-21% between 25% and 75% load. Whereas, the neuro-fuzzy-based controller enhances engine power (30% 60%) and reduction in brake specific fuel consumption (12%-35%) in comparison with the PID controller used in the basic engine.

Title:  Ankylosing spondylitis; Nursing; Health services research; Quality indicators; Rheumatoid arthritis        
Abstract: Nursing clinics in rheumatology (NCR) are organizational care models that provide care centred within the scope of nurses abilities. To analyse patients differences in the knowledge of the disease, adherence to the treatment, quality indicators of the Rheumatology Departments included quality perceived by the patients with and without NCR. National multicenter observational prospective cohort study 1 year follow-up, comparing patients attending rheumatology services with and without NCR. NCR was defined by the presence of: (1) office itself; (2) at least one dedicated nurse; (3) its own appointment schedule, and (4) phone. Variables included were (baseline and 12 months) Batalla, Haynes-Sackett, Morisky-Green and quality perceived tests. In addition, another specific questionnaire was drawn up to collect the healthcare, teaching and research activities of each Rheumatology Department. A total of 393 patients were included; 181 NCR and 212 not NCR, corresponding to 39 units, 21 with NCR and 18 without NCR (age 53 +/- 11.8 vs 56 +/- 13.5 years). Significant differences in favour of the NCR group were found in Haynes-Sackett (p = 0.033) and Morisky-Green (p = 0.03) tests in the basal visit. Significant differences were found in questions about ""the courtesy and/or kindness received by the nurse"", being ""good or very good"" in greater proportion in the NCR group. The publications from the last 5 years were significantly higher in the NCR group in both, national (p = 0.04) and international (p = 0.03) journals. A higher research activity and quality perceived by the patients are observed in the Rheumatology Departments with NCR.

Title:  HIV-1; transcription; replication; host factor        
Abstract: CXCR4-using HIV-1 was previously shown to replicate more efficiently in a healthy donor-derived CD4(+) CD38(+) than in a CD4+ CD38(-) T-cell subset after stimulation with interleukin(IL)-4. Here, we identified 3 cellular genes, which were expressed to a higher level in an IL-4-stimulated CD38(-) subset. One of the 3 genes, RNF125/TRAC-1, was involved in the down-regulation of HIV-1 replication not only in cell lines, but also in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RNFI25/TRAC-1 bears the RING finger domain, important for E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. Mutations in this domain of RNFl25/TRAC-1 led to the loss of HIV-1 down-modulatory activity, suggesting that E3 ligase activity is necessary. In addition, the results of Northern blotting and reporter gene analysis indicated that RNFl25/TRAC-1 function occurs at the viral transcription step. These results suggest that RNFI25/TRAC-1 could function to recruit host factor(s) controlling HIV-1 transcription to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Satellite pose detection; Pose estimation; Pose initialization; Appearance learning; Feature clustering        
Abstract: In this paper we present a learning-based 3D detection of a highly challenging specular object exposed to a direct sunlight at very close-range. An object detection is one of the most important areas of image processing, and can also be used for initialization of local visual tracking methods. While the object detection in 3D space is generally a difficult problem, it poses more difficulties when the object is specular and exposed to the direct sunlight as in a space environment. Our solution to a such problem relies on an appearance learning of a real satellite mock-up based on a vector quantization and the vocabulary tree. Our method, implemented on a standard computer (CPU), exploits a full perspective projection model and provides near real-time 3D pose detection of a satellite for close-range approach and manipulation. The time consuming part of the training (feature description, building the vocabulary tree and indexing, depth buffering and back-projection) are performed offline, while a fast image retrieval and 3D-2D registration are performed on-line. In contrast, the state of the art image-based 3D pose detection methods are slower on CPU or assume a weak perspective camera projection model. In our case the dimension of the satellite is larger than the distance to the camera, hence the assumption of the weak perspective model does not hold. To evaluate the proposed method, the appearance of a full scale mock-up of the rear part of the TerraSAR-X satellite is trained under various illumination and camera views. The training images are captured with a camera mounted on six degrees of freedom robot, which enables to position the camera in a desired view, sampled over a sphere. The views that are not within the workspace of the robot are interpolated using image-based rendering. Moreover, we generate ground truth poses to verify the accuracy of the detection algorithm. The achieved results are robust and accurate even under noise due to specular reflection, and able to initialize a local tracking method.

Title:  adipose; beta-adrenergic agonist; gene expression; lipogenesis; pig; ractopamine        
Abstract: The long-term effect of feeding the catecholamine analog ractopamine (RAC; ractopamine hydrochloride, Elanco Animal Health, Indianapolis, IN) on the expression of genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism in subcutaneous adipose tissue was studied. Large White pigs (84 kg) were fed corn- and soybean meal-based diets supplemented with 0, 20, or 60 mg/kg of RAC for 14, 28, or 42 d. Expression (mRNA abundance) in adipose tissue of sterol regulatory binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma 2, fatty acid synthase (FAS), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase was determined by Northern blotting. Feed intakes did not differ, and RAC (20 and 60 mg/kg) improved BW gain at d 14, 28, and 42 (P < 0.05) and increased loin eye area (measured on d 42 only; P < 0.05). Expression of SREBP-1 and PPAR gamma 2 declined (P < 0.05) with RAC by d 28 and 42, whereas expression of PPAR alpha was increased (P < 0.05) on d 14, 28, and 42. After 14 d, expression of FAS and GLUT4 was decreased (P < 0.05) with 60 mg/kg of RAC, whereas both RAC concentrations attenuated FAS expression on d 28 and 42. Overall, adipose tissue stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression was not affected by RAC but showed somewhat less expression (P < 0.15) on d 28 at 60 mg/kg of RAC. Although prolonged, chronic RAC feeding most likely downregulates adipose tissue membrane beta-adrenergic receptors, mRNA abundances of anabolic lipid metabolism transcription factors, glucose transporters, and enzymes (SREBP-1, PPAR gamma 2, FAS, GLUT4) were still attenuated up to d 42. Conversely, a transcription factor related to oxidative metabolism expression (PPAR alpha) was enhanced. We conclude that even after 42 d, RAC still decreased expression of lipogenic genes in adipose tissue by yet undefined cyclic adenosine monophosphate-directed mechanisms, but in contemporary lean pigs, this effect is likely of limited practical significance.

Title:  Active learning (AL); hyperspectral image (HSI) classification; semisupervised learning; sparse graph regularization; sparse representation (SR); total variation        
Abstract: Regularization has appeared explicitly in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification community, which serves as a promising paradigm for leveraging labeled and unlabeled information, computer's automation and user's interaction, spectral and spatial information, and so on. Graph-based regularization is capable of modeling the nonlinear structures embedded in high-dimensional space, with the great potential for HSI classification. However, traditional methods exhibit low capacity when facing noisy and large-scale data, thus posing a big challenge for their successful use in this community. In this paper, we present two novel sparse graph regularization methods, SGR and SGR with total variation (TV-SGR). In SGR, the labels of large unknown data are propagated based on the fraction matrix and the prediction function, where the fraction matrix is obtained using an effective sparse representation (SR) algorithm with respect to the dictionary, and the prediction function is estimated by optimizing a typical graph-based regularization problem. In contrast, TV-SGR is an extension of SGR by considering spatial information modeled by total variation in SR. Propagating the prediction function from dictionary to large unknown data using the fraction matrix is the essence of the paradigm. SGR and TV-SGR can be equipped with semisupervised learning, active learning, and spectral-spatial classification with large flexibility. The experimental results with two popular hyperspectral data sets indicate that the proposed methods outperform some state-of-the-art approaches in terms of computational efficacy, classification accuracy, and robustness to noise.

This study developed and refined an intervention to provide clinician support to facilitate use of the PTSD Coach app and gathered VA provider and patient qualitative and quantitative feedback on CS-PTSD Coach to investigate preliminary acceptability and implementation barriers/ facilitators. VA primary care providers and mental health leadership (N = 9) completed a survey and interview regarding implementation barriers and facilitators structured according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Clinicians who delivered CS-PTSD Coach (N = 3) and patients (N = 9) who received it provided feedback on the intervention and implementation process. CS-PTSD Coach has high provider and patient acceptability. Important implementation factors included that CS-PTSD Coach be compatible with the clinics' current practices, have low complexity to implement, be perceived to address patient needs, and have strong support from leadership. Diverse factors related to CS-PTSD Coach delivery facilitate implementation, provide an opportunity to problem-solve barriers, and improve integration of the intervention into primary care.

Title:  stroke; language impairment; children        
Abstract: Arteriovenous malformations are the most common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages in older children. Intracerebral hematoma can cause serious lasting neurologic, cognitive, and language deficits, or even possible death. We present the case of a 16-year-old boy who had language impairments after suffering a large hemorrhagic stroke in the left temporoparietal region. All language components, verbal and nonverbal communication, reading, and writing, were found to be affected. These impairments were expected as they are characteristic of the location of the hematoma. After a year of speech language rehabilitation, there was an almost complete recovery of language skills. Quick diagnosis and adequate therapeutic interventions are important to diminish the influence of intracerebral hemorrhage on cognitive and language functions in children.

Title:  Interconnect; model reduction; Krylov subspace; pseudo-inverse; minimum norm; space projection        
Abstract: In recent years, model order reduction (MOR) of interconnect system has become an important technique to reduce the computation complexity and improve the verification efficiency in the nanometer VLSI design. The Krylov subspaces techniques in existing MOR methods are efficient, and have become the methods of choice for generating small-scale macro-models of the large-scale multi-port RCL networks that arise in VLSI interconnect analysis. Although the Krylov subspace projection-based MOR methods have been widely studied over the past decade in the electrical computer-aided design community, all of them do not provide a best optimal solution in a given order. In this paper, a minimum norm least-squares solution for MOR by Krylov subspace methods is proposed. The method is based on generalized inverse (or pseudo inverse) theory. This enables a new criterion for MOR-based Krylov subspace projection methods. Two numerical examples are used to test the PRIMA method based on the method proposed in this paper as a standard model.

Abstract: The importance we attach to our perception of light and colour and its emotional effects is discussed with reference to experimental work. The question of whether red is a more activating colour than blue is discussed by reference to two opposing schools of thought. One is based on colour light and measured by physiological changes in the central and autonomic nervous system and the other is based on colour pigment applied in interior and exterior spaces. The question whether colour affects the subjective estimation of time and warmth is also discussed with reference to experimental work. The ongoing debate of colour aesthetics and, in particular colour preferences is discussed on a longitudinal basis for the past 40 years of teaching the subject in the Oxford School of Architecture.

Title:  proximal gradient methods; variable metric; line search methods; image processing applications        
Abstract: We consider a variable metric linesearch based proximal gradient method for the minimization of the sum of a smooth, possibly nonconvex function plus a convex, possibly nonsmooth term. We prove convergence of this iterative algorithm to a critical point if the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property at each point of its domain, under the assumption that a limit point exists. The proposed method is applied to a wide collection of image processing problems and our numerical tests show that our algorithm results to be flexible, robust and competitive when compared to recently proposed approaches able to address the optimization problems arising in the considered applications.

Title:  Fractional order controller; Twin rotor; Nelder-Mead optimization; Classical PID        
Abstract: This paper presents an application of fractional order controller for the control of multi input multi output twin rotor aerodynamic system. Dynamics of the considered system are highly nonlinear and there exists a significant cross-coupling between the horizontal and vertical axes (pitch & yaw). In this paper, a fractional order model of twin rotor aerodynamic system is identified using input output data from nonlinear system. Based upon identified fractional order model, a fractional order PID controller is designed to control the angular position of level bar of twin rotor aerodynamic system. The parameters of controller are tuned using Nelder-Mead optimization and compared with particle swarm optimization techniques. Simulation results on the nonlinear model show a significant improvement in the performance of fractional order PID controller as compared to a classical PID controller.

Title:  Hereditary angioedema; C1-inhibitor deficiency; Trigger factor; Emotional stress; Coping; Glucocorticoid polymorphisms; Glucocorticoid sensitivity        
Abstract: Background: Hereditary angioedema caused by C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder. C1-INH-HAE is characterized by edema-formation, which may occur in response to stress. The individual's response to stress stimuli is partly genetically determined. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis results in the release of cortisol. In turn, the secreted gluco-and mineralocorticoids affect the metabolism, as well as the cardiovascular and immune systems. We hypothesized that changes in serum cortisol level and polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modify the individual sensitivity to stressor stimuli of C1-INH-HAE patients. Results: We compared the response to stress with Rahe's Brief Stress and Coping Inventory of 43 C1-INH-HAE patients, 18 angioedema patients and 13 healthy controls. 139 C1-INH-HAE patients and 160 healthy controls were genotyped for glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms BclI, N363S and A3669G. Serum cortisol levels were determined during attacks and during symptom-free periods in 36 C1-INH-HAE patients. The relationships between clinical, laboratory data and GR SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) were assessed using ANOVA. C1-INH-HAE patients have decreased coping capabilities compared to healthy controls. Cortisol levels were significantly higher during attacks than in symptom-free periods (p = 0.004). The magnitude of the elevation of cortisol levels did not show a significant correlation with any clinical or laboratory data. Among the C1-INH-HAE patients, the carriers of the A3669G allele had significantly lower cortisol levels, and increased body mass index compared with non-carriers. Conclusions: The higher cortisol level observed during attacks may reflect the effect of a stressful situation (such as of the attack itself), on the patients' neuroendocrine system. In A3669G carriers, the lower cortisol levels might reflect altered feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, due to decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoids.

Title:  knowledge representation; standard model; ontology; system theory; control theory; multidimensional representation        
Abstract: Knowledge representation is the core of artificial intelligence research. Knowledge representation methods include predicate logic, semantic network, computer programming language, database, mathematical model, graphics language, natural language, etc. To establish the intrinsic link between various knowledge representation methods, a unified knowledge representation model is necessary. According to ontology, system theory, and control theory, a standard model of knowledge representation that reflects the change of the objective world is proposed. The model is composed of input, processing, and output. This knowledge representation method is not a contradiction to the traditional knowledge representation method. It can express knowledge in terms of multivariate and multidimensional. It can also express process knowledge, and at the same time, it has a strong ability to solve problems. In addition, the standard model of knowledge representation provides a way to solve problems of non-precision and inconsistent knowledge.

Title:  Software game; Game performance; Video game; Online game; Process assessment; Software process improvement; Game development methodology        
Abstract: Game development is an interdisciplinary concept that embraces artistic, software engineering, management, and business disciplines. This research facilitates a better understanding of important dimensions of digital game development methodology. Game development is considered as one of the most complex tasks in software engineering. The increased popularity of digital games, the challenges faced by game development organizations in developing quality games, and high competition in the digital game industry demand a game development maturity assessment. Consequently, this study presents a Digital Game Maturity Model to evaluate the current development methodology in an organization. The framework of this model consists of assessment questionnaires, a performance scale, and a rating method. The main goal of the questionnaires is to collect information about current processes and practices. In general, this research contributes towards formulating a comprehensive and unified strategy for game development maturity evaluation. Two case studies were conducted and their assessment results reported. These demonstrate the level of maturity of current development practices in two organizations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title:  North Atlantic right whale; Acoustic monitoring; Upcall detection; Local binary patterns; Classification        
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two-stage classification strategies in detecting north Atlantic right whale upcalls. Time-frequency measurements of data from passive acoustic monitoring devices are evaluated as images. Vocalization spectrograms are preprocessed for noise reduction and tone removal. First stage of the algorithm eliminates non-upcalls by an energy detection algorithm. In the second stage, two sets of features are extracted from the remaining signals using contour-based.and texture based methods. The former is based on-extraction of time-frequency features from upcall contours, and the latter employs a Local Binary Pattern operator to extract distinguishing texture features of the upcalls. Subsequently evaluation phase is carried out by using several classifiers to assess the effectiveness of both the contour-based and texture-based features for upcall detection. Comparing ROC curves of machine learning algorithms obtained from Cornell University's dataset reveals that LBP features improved performance accuracy up to 43% over time-frequency features. Classifiers such as the Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, and TreeBagger achieve highest upcall detection rates with LBP features.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  combination antipsychotics; depot antipsychotics; long-acting antipsychotics; treatment-resistant schizophrenia        
Abstract: Objective: This case report describes a forensic psychiatric patient presenting with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and serious interpersonal violence complicated by poor adherence to oral medication who was treated successfully with two concurrent long-acting depot antipsychotics. Method: Treatment response was measured for a 6-month period at 6-weekly intervals, post-initiation using the Positive and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia with Excited Component score (PANSS-EC), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). Results: At 6 months, the presentation was found to have markedly improved. The overall PANSS-EC score was reduced by 43.9%, with reductions in Positive Symptom and Excited Component subscales most evident. BPRS Score was reduced from 81 at baseline to 47 at 18 weeks. There was improvement in the patient's level of cooperativeness, aggression and engagement in ward therapeutic activities. Conclusion: Although concurrent use of two depot antipsychotics requires further exploration, there is potential benefit for patient groups presenting with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and poor compliance. Due to risk of serious adverse effects which are difficult to reverse with long-acting formulations, we recommend this option be reserved for this complex patient population and exclusively in care settings allowing close physical health monitoring.

Abstract: This secondary data analysis examined the association of Head Start children's entry age and enrollment duration on children's dental, vision, and hearing health based on data from 60 local Head Start classrooms. Children were divided into three groups: One group of children entered Head Start at age three and maintained enrollment for one year (Group 1). The second group of children entered Head Start at age four and stayed one year (Group 2). The third group of children entered at age three and stayed in Head Start for two years (Group 3). Compared with Group 3, Group 1 had fewer dental problems and Group 2 had less identified hearing problems. Children's gender, ethnicity, and program characteristics and family risk factors were associated with health problems.

Title:  Irish Travellers; anti-oppressive practice; psychodynamic study of racism; dialogue        
Abstract: This paper is a reflective exploration of the emotional encounter between social workers and Irish Travellers in child safeguarding cases in the UK, the unconscious defences that may be triggered for social workers, unfamiliar with Travellers, and how these can impact on the relationship and outcomes. It raises concern about how pervasive societal disapproval towards Travellers may be absorbed by social workers, at the expense of a curiosity about historic marginalisation, the contemporary cultural and social context and a recognition of the strengths of the community. Drawing on psychoanalytical insights into race', it comprises a literature review which highlights themes of marginalisation in research on Irish Travellers in the UK. It also includes a narrative interview with a Traveller woman who reflects on the fear that social workers invoke in Travellers, and sets up the key question: what might the emotional state of the social worker be in this scenario.

Title:  quantum key distribution; entanglement swapping; long-distance quantum communication        
Abstract: We explain how to share photons between two distant parties using concatenated entanglement swapping and assess performance according to the two-photon visibility as the figure of merit. From this analysis, we readily see the key generation rate and the quantum bit error rate as figures of merit for this scheme applied to quantum key distribution (QKD). Our model accounts for practical limitations, including higher-order photon pair events, dark counts, detector inefficiency, and photon losses. Our analysis shows that compromises are needed among the runtimes for the experiment, the rate of producing photon pairs, and the choice of detector efficiency. From our quantitative results, we observe that concatenated entanglement swapping enables secure QKD over long distances but at key generation rates that are far too low to be useful for large separations. We find that the key generation rates are close to both the Takeoka-Guha-Wilde and the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi bounds. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

Title:  Copper; iron; selenium; skeleton; bone; chondrocytes        
Abstract: Nutrients have been known to have a significant role in maintaining the health of the skeleton, both bone and cartilage. The nutrients that have received the majority of the attention are Vitamin D and calcium. However, limited attention has been directed toward three trace elements that may have mechanistic impact upon the skeletal tissues and could compromise skeletal health resulting from inadequate intakes of copper, iron, and selenium. The role of copper and selenium has been known, but the role of iron has only received recent attention. Copper deficiency is thought to impact bone health by a decrease in lysyl oxidase, a copper-containing enzyme, which facilitates collagen fibril crosslinking. Iron deficiency impact upon bone has only recently been discovered but the exact mechanism on how the deficient states enhance bone pathology is speculative. Selenium deficiency has an impact on cartilage thereby having an indirect impact on bone. However, several studies suggest that a mycotoxin when consumed by humans is the culprit in some cartilage disorders and the presence of selenium could attenuate the pathology. This review summarizes the current knowledge base with respect to skeletal integrity when each of these three trace elements are inadequate in diets of both animals and humans.

Title:  Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate; chondrocalcinosis; pseudogout        
Abstract: Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD) is a type of arthritis caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals, and may present as either acute or chronic arthritis. Development of CPPD crystal deposition disease in young people may be associated with metabolic diseases such as hemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, Wilson's disease, hypothyroidism, gout, acromegaly, and X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. Therefore, investigations for a predisposing metabolic condition are advised in young-onset polyarticular CPPD crystal deposition disease. In this article, we report two young patients who were investigated for recurrent joint pain due to CPPD disease.

Title:  Diesel passenger car; Waste heat energy recovery; Driving cycle; Exergy analysis        
Abstract: This work addresses the potential for waste energy recovery from exhaust gases in a diesel passenger car mounted in a chassis dynamometer. The New European Driving Cycle was followed, while recording relevant operating variables. Tests were performed under three temperature conditions, and exergy analysis was included to find the potential of exhaust gases to produce useful work at six points in the exhaust system. Results include mean temperature at each point, as well as the energy quality index, which was lower than 33%, meaning that less than one-third of the energy of exhaust gases can be converted into useful work in a recovery system. In general, the highest exergy losses were found in the muffler. Although the greatest recovery potential corresponds to the highest temperature of gases, environmental regulations for vehicles restrict waste energy recovery to be performed downstream after-treatment devices, which, in the present work, was the outlet of the diesel particle filter. Temperature of gases at this location varied in the range 115-320 degrees C, and potential fuel saving varied between 8% and 19% for the complete driving cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title:  contact angle; hydrophobic concrete; super-hydrophobicity; hierarchical roughness        
Abstract: We report here, for the first time in the literature, a method to synthesize hydrophobic and superhydrophobic concrete. Concrete is normally a hydrophilic material, which significantly reduces the durability of concrete structures and pavements. To synthesize water-repellent concrete, hydrophobic emulsions were fabricated and applied on portland cement mortar tiles. The emulsion was enriched with the polymethyl-hydrogen siloxane oil hydrophobic agent as well as metakaolin (MK) or silica fume (SF) to induce the microroughness and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers to create hierarchical surfaces. Various emulsion types were investigated by using different mixing procedures, and single- and double-layer hydrophobic coatings were applied. The emulsions and coatings were characterized with optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM), and their wetting properties, including the water contact angle (CA) and roll-off angle, were measured. A theoretical model for coated and non-coated concrete, which can be generalized for other types of materials, was developed to predict the effect of surface roughness and composition on the CA. An optimized distance between the aggregates was found where the CA has the highest value. The maximal CA measured was 156 for the specimen with PVA fibers treated with MK based emulsion. Since water penetration is the main factor leading to concrete deterioration, hydrophobic water-repellent concretes have much longer durability then regular concretes and can have a broad range of applications in civil and materials engineering.

Title:  Case-based reasoning; Overview; Construction management        
Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) has been widely adopted in construction management (CM) research due to the similar mind-sets of CBR and CM problem solving. However, to date, there has been no systematic review of CBR applications in previous CM studies, raising the question of what is the current status quo of CBR applications in CM research? By using the method of content analysis, this study provides a comprehensive literature review of CM CBR articles published between 1996 and January 2015. It is found that the popularity of CBR applications in CM research is increasing, especially after 2006, with a majority emanating from South Korea. In addition, 17 CBR application fields are identified, with the primary research interests focusing on construction cost estimation, construction tendering, bidding and procurement, and environment and sustainability management. Issues in previous CBR model developments are also identified, mainly related to model hypothesis-testing, reuse of case outcomes, selection of model development methods, use of derivational analogy and automated implementation, together with future research suggestions and directions. This study helps provide CM academics and practitioners with a more comprehensive understanding of the development of CBR applications and implications for future studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title:  bridges; footbridges; timber structures        
Abstract: The potential of mechanical lamination of timber for bridge construction and its application in developing structural uses for low-grade, UK-grown timber is investigated. A mechanically laminated pedestrian bridge is designed as a half-scale of a 12 m span bridge and subjected to a series of experimental and analytical investigations. A flat, stress-laminated timber deck is formed by transversely post-tensioning short timber planks with steel bars. The resulting orthotropic solid plate is suspended from two screw-laminated slender timber arches, in which timber predominately acts in compression and end-bearing at the butt ends. The structure is subjected to a series of deck loading conditions up to failure loads. The bridge behaves elastically well beyond its design load, and shows a high level of ductility and recovery capacity. Failure of the structure arises from lateral instability of the arches under symmetrical deck loading. A commercial finite-element analysis programme is used to predict the behaviour of the structure. Close agreement between the analytical and experimental results demonstrates that the structural performance of mechanically laminated timber structures can be reasonably accurately predicted using linear elastic analysis. The study also shows that relatively large-span, stiff, strong structures can be constructed using means of short lengths of low-quality timber.

Title:  physiological sleep; questionnaire; gender; elderly; parasomnia; sleep-related movement disorder; healthy sleeper        
Abstract: Study Objectives: Despite several polysomnographic normative studies and multiple surveys of sleep disorders in the general population, few data have been collected on healthy sleepers. We aimed to survey the characteristics of healthy sleep. Methods: We prospectively investigated the sleep history of 100 subjects of a representative population sample who reported undisturbed sleep and in whom relevant sleep disorders were ruled out by a two-step screening procedure. Approximately four subjects had to be contacted for identifying 1 eligible subject who participated. Results: The median reported time in bed was from 23: 00 (21:30-02:00) to 07:00 (05:30-11:00). The total sleep duration was 7.3 h (5-10 h), varying from 7.5 h in the age group60 years (p = 0.002). The median sleep efficiency was high (93.3%, range: 55.6% to 100%). Fifty-one subjects reported occasional snoring. Forty-five subjects reported sporadic non-bothersome sleep-related movement disorders (25 sleep-related leg cramps, 22 lifetime bruxism, 5 restless legs syndrome), and 36 had a history of sporadic non-bothersome parasomnias (27 nightmares, 12 sleepwalking, 1 sleep paralysis). Conclusion: In this population of healthy sleepers, snoring is the most common finding. Moreover, non-bothersome forms of recognizable sleep-related movement disorders and parasomnias are surprisingly common. These findings may suggest that diagnostic criteria of sleep disorders should not only be based on the presence of symptoms but also account for a minimum frequency or discomfort.

Title:  Hierarchical structure; Mesopore; Nanosheet; Crystal facet; Photocatalysis; Degradation        
Abstract: Developing highly active photocatalysts for water treatment is of vital importance. A large-mesopore hierarchical WO3 hydrate photocatalyst with exposed high energy facets was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method using sodium chloride as structure-directing agent. The forming model of the hierarchical structure was discussed, and photogenerated oxide species were investigated. It is shown that the orthorhombic WO3 center dot 1/3H(2)O photocatalyst is of a hierarchical structure assembled by various 2-dimension nanosheets and that its average pore diameter reaches approximately 33.2 nm. Besides, it could decompose 92% of rhodamine B (Rh B) under visible light irradiation within four hours. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency is attributed to the exposed high energy (002) crystal facets of hierarchical structure, and to the large mesopores existing between crossed nanosheets which help to charge carriers separation, adsorption of reactants and desorption of product molecules. Furthermore, the catalyst displays an excellent photocatalytic stability, indicating its broad application in water pollution treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  Iodine; Congenital hypothyroidism; Epidemiology        
Abstract: Italy is dealing with iodine deficiency since ancient times. In 1848 an ad hoc committee appointed by the king of Sardinia, identified extensive areas afflicted by endemic goiter and endemic cretinism in Piedmont, Liguria and Sardinia. Since then many epidemiological studies have been conducted in our country. These showed that iodine deficiency was present not only in mountain areas but also in coastal areas. In 1972 the iodization of salt at 15 mg/kg was allowed by law and iodized salt was distributed on request to selected endemic areas. Five years later the distribution was extended to the whole country. However the sale of iodized salt was not mandatory at that time and only a small fraction of the Italian population started using iodized salt. In 1991 the content of iodine in the salt was raised to 30 mg/kg and in 2005 a nationwide salt iodization program was finally implemented. Some years later a nationwide monitoring program of iodine prophylaxis was also implemented. Since 2005 the sale of iodized salt in Italian supermarkets has increased (34% in 2006, 55% in 2012), although it has been observed that the use of iodized salt is still low in the communal eating areas and in the food industry. These data are coherent with recent epidemiological studies showing that some regions in our country are still characterized by mild iodine deficiency and a high frequency of goiter and other iodine deficiency disorders. This implies that further efforts should be made to successfully correct iodine deficiency in Italy.

Title:  Varenicline; Bupropion; Smoking cessation        
Abstract: Background: Within the context of the support program for smoking cessation, initiated by the Turkish Ministry of Health in 2011, those who present at 'smoking cessation' centres and are found to be suitable for pharmacological treatment are given varenicline and bupropion free of charge. As the smoking cessation programme is centralized, the selection of the medication is made randomly to provide a fixed distribution rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of both varenicline and bupropion in smoking cessation and to evaluate the effect of the smoking cessation programme. Methods: A total of 405 individuals who met the study criteria were included in the study. Smoking habits and degree of dependence were determined in all the participants with the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND) and bupropion or varenicline therapy was initiated in those who were eligible. Patients were followed up at 15 days then at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after smoking cessation. A level of CO < 5 ppm and 'point prevalence abstinence' were used as the criteria of success for smoking cessation and this evaluation showed the non-smoking status in the previous 7 days. Results: The mean age of the participants was 35.19 +/- 7.73 years and 82.8% (n = 334) were male. Of the participants, 60.2% (n = 244) were given varenicline and 39.8% (n = 161) bupropion. The mean FTND and package/year was not significantly different between the groups. The rates of success in the 1st and 2nd weeks, and 1st, 3rd and 6th months were significantly higher in the varenicline group than in the bupropion group (p < 0.05). At the end of one year, the rate of smoking cessation was determined as 13.9% (n = 34) in the varenicline group and 6.2% (n = 10) in the bupropion gruop. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.015). At the end of 1 year when the previous 7 days smoking status was evaluated with the 'point prevalence abstinence' measurement as the success criteria, success rates were 20.5% with varenicline and 18.6% with bupropion and the difference was not significant (p = 0.646). The individuals who used the medications for 45 days or longer were more successful in smoking cessation (p < 0.001). The most common reasons given for discontinuing the medication were the side-effects (31.5%). No significant difference was determined between the groups in respect of the side-effects observed. Conclusions: Although the rates of smoking cessation in all the other control points were higher with varenicline than with bupropion, no significant difference was found between the success rates of varenicline and bupropion used in smoking cessation based on the last 7 days at the end of one year. Those who used the medications for 45 days or longer were more successful in smoking cessation.

Title:  Electrochemical impedance; Interfacial conductivity; Fick's second law; Warburg impedance; Gerischer impedance        
Abstract: Theoretical impedance relationships in a limiting process with non-steady-state surface diffusion were derived based on the interfacial conductivity concept at the interface between an oxygen ion conductor and a metallic electrode. While the non-steady-state surface diffusion of adsorbed neutral oxygen on the metallic electrode could be described by Fick's second law, approximated and equivalent equations to the Warburg impedance and Gerischer impedance were derived according to the boundary conditions and occurrence of dissipation by the chemical reaction. The diffusion related to the electrochemical impedance signal is not the diffusion of the oxygen ions. In addition, it is not necessary to assume an electrochemical potential gradient or profile of the free electrons in the metallic electrode. The relationships obtained in this paper indicate that electrochemical potential measured by an instrument is clearly defined by the electrochemical potential of free electrons at the triple phase boundary. The meaning of the equivalent electrical circuits corresponding to the impedance spectra is reconsidered from the view points of the interfacial conductivity concept.

Title:  permethrin; permethrin metabolism; human alcohol dehydrogenase; human aldehyde dehydrogenase        
Abstract: Permethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide widely used in agriculture and public health. It has been suggested that permethrin may interact with other chemicals used during military deployments and, as a result, be a potential cause of Gulf War Related Illness. To determine the causal relationship between permethrin and human health effects, the basic enzymatic pathway of permethrin metabolism in humans should be understood. In the present study we report that trans-permethrin is metabolized in human liver fractions, producing phenoxybenzyl alcohol (PBOH) and phenoxybenzoic acid (PBCOOH). We identified human alcohol (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) as the enzymes involved in the oxidation of phenoxybenzyl alcohol, the permethrin hydrolysis product, to phenoxybenzoic acid by way of phenoxybenzaldehyde (PBCHO). Cis-permethrin was not significantly metabolized in human liver fractions. Cytochrome P450 isoforms were not involved either in the hydrolysis of trans-permethrin or in the oxidation of PBOH to PBCOOH. Purified ADH isozymes oxidized PBOH to PBCHO and PBOH was a preferred substrate to ethyl alcohol. Purified ALDH was responsible for PBCHO oxidation to PBCOOH with similar substrate affinity to a previously known substrate, bcnzyl alcohol. Based on these observations, it appears that PBOH is oxidized to PBCHO by ADH and subsequently to PBCOOH by ALDH, although PBCHO does not accumulate during microsomal incubation. In order to analyze permethrin and its metabolites, previous HPLC-UV methods had to be re-validated and modified. The resulting refined HPLC-UV method is described in detail.

Title:  Microbiome; Mucosal immunology; Autoimmune disease; Inflammatory bowel disease; Helminth immunotherapy        
Abstract: Mammalian evolution has occurred in the presence of mutualistic, commensal, and pathogenic micro-and macro-organisms for millennia. The presence of these organisms during mammalian evolution has allowed for intimate crosstalk between these colonizing species and the host immune system. In this review, we introduce the concept of the 'multibiome' to holistically refer to the biodiverse collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi and multicellular helminthic worms colonizing the mammalian intestine. Furthermore, we discuss new insights into multibiome-host interactions in the context of host-protective immunity and immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we provide reasons to account for the multibiome in experimental design, analysis and in therapeutic applications. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title:  Carcinoma; cell biology; matrix metalloproteinases; microbiology; polyphenols; Porphyromonas gingivalis        
Abstract: Background: Recent epidemiologic studies have revealed a significant association between periodontitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Furthermore, periodontitis is markedly associated with orodigestive cancer mortality, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) infection has been identified as a specific and potentially independent microbial factor related to increased risk of orodigestive cancer death. The authors previously reported that Pg induced the precursor form of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (proMMP-9) production via proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-related pathways, after which proMMP-9 was activated by gingipains to enhance cellular invasion of SAS cells. In the present study, effects of selected polyphenols as inhibitors of cellular invasion caused by Pg gingipains in SAS cells are examined. Methods: OSCC cells were infected with Pg strains including gingipain mutants. To evaluate effects of inhibitors: 1) apple polyphenol (AP); 2) hop bract polyphenol (HBP); 3) high-molecular-weight fractions of HBP (HMW-HBP); 4) low-molecular-weight fractions of HBP (LMW-HBP); 5) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg); 6) KYT-1 (Arg-gingipain inhibitor); and KYT-36 (Lys-gingipain inhibitor) in combination are used. PAR2 and PAR4 mRNA expressions are examined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and signaling pathways are evaluated by western blotting analysis. Results: KYT-1/KYT-36, AP, HBP, and HMW-HBP significantly inhibited PAR2 and PAR4 mRNA expressions, proMMP-9 activation, and cellular invasion. Furthermore, AP, HBP, and HMW-HBP reduced activation of heat shock protein 27 and Ets1 and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B, whereas EGCg and LMW-HBP did not. Conclusion: These results suggest that AP, HBP, HMW-HBP are potent inhibitors of proMMP-9 activation and cellular invasion mediated with Pg in OSCC cells.

Title:  mastitis pathogen; polymerase chain reaction; colostrum        
Abstract: The performance of a commercial, real-time PCR. assay was compared with traditional bacterial culture for the identification of Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus in bovine milk collected at different stages of lactation. Initial validation tests using fresh and frozen quarter milk samples identified factors that affected the success of the PCR. Therefore, the standard protocol was adjusted for samples collected at the first milking postpartum (colostrum) and from clinical mastitis cases. The adjustment involved PCR testing both undiluted and diluted (1 in 10 with sterile water) DNA extracts. The performance comparison between culture and the PCB assay used milk samples collected aseptically from individual quarters of mixed-age spring-calving dairy cows, during early, mid, and late lactation. Bacterial culture results were used to select a subset of samples for PC.R. testing (n = 315) that represented quarters with a current or prior Strep. uberis or Staph,. aureus infection. Compared with culture, PCR had a sensitivity of 86.8% and specificity of 87.7% for detecting Strep. uberis (kappa = 0.74) and 96.4% and 99.7%, respectively, for detecting Staph. aureus (kappa = 0.96). The dilution of DNA extracts for colostrum and clinical samples increased the relative sensitivity from 79.2% to 86.8% for Strep. uberis detection and from 92.9% to 96.4% for Staph. aureus, presumably through diluting unidentified PCR, inhibitors. The sensitivity for detecting Strep. uberis using PCR, relative to culture, was similar throughout lactation (85-89%), whereas relative specificity was lowest immediately postcalving (64%) but improved in mid and late lactation (98%). Specificity estimates for samples collected in early lactation can be optimized by reducing the cutoff cycle threshold (Ct) value from the recommended value of 37 to 34. Although using this value improved specificity (77%), it reduced test sensitivity (77%). The PCR. assay lacked agreement with culture in early lactation, specifically for diagnosing Strep. uberis. Thus, PCB. should not be used as the only tool for diagnosing mastitis in early lactation.

Title:  nonlinear systems; flatness; exact linearization; tracking control; disturbance rejection        
Abstract: Since their introduction in the late eighties and early nineties of the last century, flat systems have become well established in control theory and also in control engineering. This stems from the fact that for this class of systems trajectories can be planned easily. Moreover, for lumped parameter systems these trajectories can be stabilized in a straightforward way. In this contribution, after a short introduction the basics of control design, trajectory planning and stabilization are shown. These are then demonstrated by two simple examples, namely a gyroscopic pendulum as well as a uniaxial model of a car. As more extensive illustrative example finally trajectory planning and nonlinear control for a gantry crane are discussed, where theoretic results, simulations and laboratory experiments are presented.

Title:  optogenetics; electrophysiology; implantable optoelectronic probes; multi photon imaging; optrode; optetrode; transparent electrodes        
Abstract: More than a decade has passed since optics and genetics came together and lead to the emerging technologies of optogenetics. The advent of light-sensitive opsins made it possible to optically trigger the neurons into activation or inhibition by using visible light. The importance of spatiotemporally isolating a segment of a neural network and controlling nervous signaling in a precise manner has driven neuroscience researchers and engineers to invest great efforts in designing high precision in vivo implantable devices. These efforts have focused on delivery of sufficient power to deep brain regions, while monitoring neural activity with high resolution and fidelity. In this review, we report the progress made in the field of hybrid optoelectronic neural interfaces that combine optical stimulation with electrophysiological recordings. Different approaches that incorporate optical or electrical components on implantable devices are discussed in detail. Advantages of various different designs as well as practical and fundamental limitations are summarized to illuminate the future of neurotechnology development.

Title:  emotion dynamics; event sampling; spirituality; transcendental positive emotions        
Abstract: This study examined the relationships between individual differences in spirituality, as measured by the Daily Spiritual Experience (DSE) scale, and the temporal dynamics of transcendental positive emotions. Using event-sampling, in which 390 participants rated their emotions repeatedly at 30-min intervals over 2 days, it was found that higher DSE was associated with higher variability and instability in transcendental positive emotions at 30-min intervals. Also, higher DSE was associated with higher inertia in transcendental positive emotions and greater switch from negative emotions to transcendental positive emotions across the 2 days. Importantly, these relationships were independent of the Five-Factor Model personality constructs, were generally not replicated in other emotions, and were also independent of the temporal dynamics of other emotions. The article discusses, among other issues, what these findings might mean for the well-being implications of spirituality.

Abstract: Under investigation in this paper is a nonisospectral and variable-coefficient fifth order Korteweg-de Vries equation in fluids. By virtue of the Bell polynomials and symbolic computation, the bilinear form, Backlund transformation and Lax pair are obtained. Based on its bilinear form, N-soliton solutions are constructed. Furthermore, periodic wave and breather wave solutions are obtained by virtue of the Riemann theta function and homoclinic test approach, respectively. In addition, the characteristic-line method is applied to discuss the features of the solitons for the nonisospectral problem, such as the amplitude, velocity and width of the solitary wave.

Title:  All-pass filter; antenna arrays; beamforming        
Abstract: An active electronically scanned array (AESA) beamforming method that provides enhanced selectivity (interference rejection) for the same number of antennas compared to conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming is proposed. Conventional DAS 2-D transfer function is modified by introducing complex pole-manifolds based on recently proposed 2-D infinite impulse response (IIR) beam filters, at guaranteed stability. A continuous-time domain signal flow graph is proposed based on first order all-pass filters that eliminate the need of transmission line-based delays used in conventional DAS beamformers. Improved interference rejection is verified using closed-form signal processing models. For an array of 64 antennas, with desired signal direction of arrival (DOA) 10 and interference DOA from array broadside, the proposed scheme shows an improvement in the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) around 7 dB for the same number of antennas, compared to DAS beamforming. The improvement in interference rejection is observed for both uniform and non-uniform aperture weights in terms of side lobe performance. A feasibility study is presented on potential CMOS circuit implementation of the proposed AESA for a linear array of eight antennas and maximum operational frequency of 1 GHz.

Title:  discrete cosine transform; fast three-dimensional discrete cosine transform algorithms; video communications; video compression; real-time video games        
Abstract: A fast three-dimensional discrete cosine transform algorithm (3D FCT) and a fast 3D inverse cosine transform (3D IFCT) algorithm are presented, suitable for analysis of 3D data points. Many existing algorithms for three-dimensional data points make use of either the 1D cosine transform or both the 2D and 1D cosine transforms. Existing algorithms based on the 1D discrete cosine transform (DCT) apply the separable 1D transform to the data points in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, while those based on 2D and 1D transforms apply the 2D cosine transform for the x-y planes and then the 1D cosine transform in the z direction. The proposed 3D DCT algorithms handle the 3D data points directly and have been shown to be computationally efficient. They involve a 3D decomposition process where a data volume is recursively decomposed in each dimension until unit data cubes are obtained. The algorithms are presented in the form of a signal flow graph which captures the various computations involved. A complexity analysis along with empirical results is included, demonstrating the performance of the proposed direct 3D DCT algorithms. As 3D FCT and IFCT are symmetric and relatively fast, they can be used in any application requiring a real-time symmetric codec, such as video conferencing, online multiparty video games, and three-dimensional graphics rendering.

Title:  Magnetic Abrasive Finishing; Magnetic Abrasive Powders; Change in Surface Roughness; material Removal; Response Surface Method        
Abstract: A great deal of attention in manufacturing engineering has been focused on finishing operations of hard and brittle materials in recent years. This paper reports an experimental work on the analysis of surface roughness and material removal using design of experiment (DOE) method in magnetic abrasive finishing, (MAF) of flat surfaces. Change in surface roughness and material removal were found to increase with an increase in weight percentage of abrasive particles in magnetic abrasive brush, lubricant volume and decrease in working gap. Also, any decrease in the relative size of the abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles would result into an increase of the surface roughness and decrease in material removal. It was observed that the work piece hardness had no considerable effect on the process results. The optimum parameter levels which lead into the best surface finish and highest material removal were also derived from these experimentations. Optimum levels included weight percentage of abrasive particles of 40%, Lubricant volume of 1 ml, working gap of 3 mm, relative size of abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles of 0.22, and work piece hardness of 82-87 HBN. Disk type test pieces were selected from Al 7075 and their two side surfaces were under experiments. Experiments were made using a milling machine spindle as magnetic pole holder, and its table as fixture holder for work pieces.

Title:  thyroid hormones; liver; FXR; NASH; methimazole        
Abstract: Hypothyroidism is associated with the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but cellular mechanisms have been scarcely analyzed. Thyroid hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of bile acids that are endogenous ligands of the farnesoid receptor (FXR alpha), which have been involved in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the relationship between thyroid hormones and FXR alpha expression in the liver is yet unknown. Control (n = 6) and methimazole-induced hypothyroid (n = 6) female rabbits were used to evaluate the amount of lipids and glycogen, vascularization, hepatocytes proliferation, immune cells infiltration, and expression of FXR alpha. Student-t or Mann-Whitney U tests were carried out to determine significant differences. Hypothyroidism induced steatosis, glycogen loss, fibrosis, and a minor vascularization in the liver. In contrast, hypothyroidism increased the proliferation of hepatocytes and the infiltration of mast cells, but did not modify the number of immune cells into sinusoids. These changes were associated with a minor anti-FXR alpha immunoreactivity of periportal hepatocytes and pericentral immune cells. Our results suggest that hypothyroidism induces a moderate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, alllowing the hepatic regeneration. The FXR alpha may be involved in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in hypothyroid subjects.

Title:  Approximate Riemann solver; Two-fluid model; Multiphase; Compressible flow; Pneumatic conveying; Hyperbolic systems        
Abstract: Two-phase gas-solids transport models are widely utilized for process design and automation in a broad range of industrial applications. Some of these applications include proppant transport in gaseous fracking fluids, air/gas drilling hydraulics, coal-gasification reactors and food processing units. Systems automation and real time process optimization stand to benefit a great deal from availability of efficient and accurate theoretical models for operations data processing. However, modeling two-phase pneumatic transport systems accurately requires a comprehensive understanding of gas-solids flow behavior. In this study we discuss the prevailing flow conditions and present a low-fidelity two-fluid model equation for particulate transport. The model equations are formulated in a manner that ensures the physical flux term remains conservative despite the inclusion of solids normal stress through the empirical formula for modulus of elasticity. A new set of Roe-Pike averages are presented for the resulting strictly hyperbolic flux term in the system of equations, which was used to develop a Roe-type approximate Riemann solver. The resulting scheme is stable regardless of the choice of flux-limiter. The model is evaluated by the prediction of experimental results from both pneumatic riser and air-drilling hydraulics systems. We demonstrate the effect and impact of numerical formulation and choice of numerical scheme on model predictions. We illustrate the capability of a low-fidelity one-dimensional two-fluid model in predicting relevant flow parameters in two-phase particulate systems accurately even under flow regimes involving counter-current flow.

Title:  hypogonadism; development and aging; health screening; health awareness        
Abstract: Millions of men, as a result of the natural aging process, injury, illness, and medical therapies, experience a decline in testosterone levels that necessitate a need for testosterone supplementation therapy (TST). The signs and symptoms of testosterone decline may occur gradually, and low testosterone levels may be misdiagnosed as other medical conditions. Over the past two decades, there has been an increase in testing of testosterone levels and the use of TST. With so many men now on TST, it is essential for health care professionals to know the signs and symptoms, the causes of testosterone decline, how testosterone deficiency is diagnosed, what pathological changes are associated with testosterone decline, and the benefits and risks of TST. In addition, health care providers need to be aware of the various forms of testosterone available as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each. This article provides a brief overview of testosterone deficiency, TST treatment options and guidelines, and the risks and benefits associated with of TST.

Title:  embryogenic potential; MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS; Pinus radiata; tree proteomics; 2-D analysis        
Abstract: Somatic embryogenesis is an important biotechnological tool in breeding and conservation programmes for woody species. It exists an increasing interest in the improvement of somatic embryogenesis induction in commercial species such as Pinus radiata. One approach to obtain markers of successful somatic embryogenesis can be the study of protein profiling in a descriptive study. In order to accomplish this objective, 2-D and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis were used in the identification and quantification of proteins from Pinus radiata D. Don somatic embryos derived from 4 cell lines that were generated under different environmental conditions at initiation stage. Based on the Swiss-Prot database, among the 139 proteins detected, 25 of them appeared only in those cell lines with low initiation percentage at the initial stage of somatic embryogenesis. Only two proteins were detected differentially in cell lines with high initiation rates. Approximately 60% of the proteins identified were related to carbohydrate metabolic process and defence response. This study gives new insights about the proteomics in forest trees, as well as provides clues on the underlying causes of the mechanisms governing Pinus radiata somatic embryogenesis process, and can serve as a tool for facing the improvement ofthe breeding programmes.

Title:  Erysiphe; cruciferarum; Cotesia glomerata; infochemical networks; insect-plant interactions; multiple herbivory        
Abstract: The co-occurrence of different antagonists on a plant can greatly affect infochemicals with ecological consequences for higher trophic levels. Here we investigated how the presence of a plant pathogen, the powdery mildew Erysiphe cruciferarum, on Brassica rapa affects (1) plant volatiles emitted in response to damage by a specialist herbivore, Pieris brassicae; (2) the attraction of the parasitic wasp Cotesia glomerata and (3) the performance of P. brassicae and C. glomerata. Plant volatiles were significantly induced by herbivory in both healthy and mildew-infected plants, but were quantitatively 41% lower for mildew-infected plants compared to healthy plants. Parasitoids strongly preferred Pieris-infested plants to dually-infested (Pieris+mildew) plants, and preferred dually infested plants over only mildew-infected plants. The performance of P. brassicae was unaffected by powdery mildew, but C. glomerata cocoon mass was reduced when parasitized caterpillars developed on mildew-infected plants. Thus, avoidance of mildew-infested plants may be adaptive for C. glomerata parasitoids, whereas P. brassicae caterpillars may suffer less parasitism on mildew-infected plants in nature. From a pest management standpoint, the concurrent presence of multiple plant antagonists can affect the efficiency of specific natural enemies, which may in turn have a negative impact on the regulation of pest populations. The co-occurrence of different antagonists on a plant can have multitrophic consequences at the community level. Here we show that infection by a fungal pathogen, the powdery mildew Erysiphe cruciferarum, on Brassica rapa strongly reduces plant volatiles emitted in response to damage by the insect herbivore Pieris brassicae, and reduces plant attractiveness to the main natural enemy of P. brassicae, the parasitic wasp Cotesia glomerata. Herbivore performance was unaffected by the presence of powdery mildew, but parasitoid performance was negatively affected (decreased cocoon mass). From a pest management standpoint, the presence of powdery mildew on Brassica plants may affect the foraging efficiency of natural enemies, which may in turn have a negative impact on the regulation of pest populations.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of joint inference and optimization in wireless networks. An optimization framework based on information-geometric network inference is developed and implemented (using a real radio emulation testbed) with scalable solutions to infer the end-to-end rate distributions of stochastic network flows from link rate measurements. The proposed low-complexity solutions apply when the underlying network inference (network tomography) problem can be decomposed to smaller-size subproblems that are solved independently by partially inferring only the flow rates of interest. The solutions are extended to infer flow rates jointly with link loss rates when retransmissions are considered over unreliable wireless links. By using the inferred distributions of flow rates, an inference mechanism is presented to optimize the network performance. First, the distributions of flow rates are inferred from the average rate measurements on selected links. Then, the distributions of all links rates are computed from the inferred distributions of flow rates. Finally, these inference results are used with network optimization. The weighted sum of link outage probabilities is minimized by adapting power control or routing decisions in mobile wireless access. This approach is iterated between network inference and optimization, providing link outage and end-to-end throughput gains compared to static approaches with fixed network (inference and optimization) parameters. The joint network inference and optimization framework is implemented with real configurable radios and the performance is verified with hardware-in-the-loop emulation test results that are obtained with actual radio transmissions over emulated channels.

Title:  Disease risk; Geographic Information System; Hotspot analysis; Landscape epidemiology; Spatial epidemiology; Water pollution        
Abstract: Clear identification of areas vulnerable to waterborne diseases is essential for protecting community health. This is particularly important in developing countries where unsafe disposal of domestic wastewater and limited potable water supply pose potential public health risks. However, data paucity can be a compounding issue. Under these circumstances, landscape epidemiology can be applied as a resource efficient approach for mapping potential disease risk areas associated with poor sanitation. However, in order to realise the full potential offered by this approach, an in-depth understanding of the impact of different classes of an explanatory variable on a target disease and the validity of hotspot analysis using limited datasets is needed. Accordingly, this research study focused on typhoid and diarrhoea incidence with respect to different classes of elevation, flood inundation, land use, soil permeability, population density and rainfall as explanatory variables. An integrated methodology consisting of hot spot analysis and Poisson regression was employed to map potential disease risk areas. The study findings confirmed the significant differences in the influence exerted by the various classes of an explanatory variable in relation to a target disease. The results also confirmed the feasibility of the hotspot analysis for identifying areas vulnerable to the target diseases using a limited dataset. The study outcomes are expected to contribute to creating an in-depth understanding of the relationship between disease prevalence and associated landscape factors for the delineation of disease risk zones in the context of data paucity.

Title:  Closed-loop deep brain stimulation; Intra-brain micro-injection; Schizophrenia; Brain repair        
Abstract: Important advances are afoot in the field of neurosurgery particularly in the realms of deep brain stimulation (DBS), deep brain manipulation (DBM), and the newly introduced refinement ""closed-loop"" deep brain stimulation (CLDBS). Use of closed-loop technology will make both DBS and DBM more precise as procedures and will broaden their indications. CLDBS utilizes as feedback a variety of sources of electrophysiological and neurochemical afferent information about the function of the brain structures to be treated or studied. The efferent actions will be either electric, i.e. the classic excitatory or inhibitory ones, or micro injection of such things as neural proteins and transmitters, neural grafts, implants of pluripotent stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells, and some variants of gene therapy. The pathologies to be treated, beside Parkinson's disease and movement disorders, include repair of neural tissues, neurodegenerative pathologies, psychiatric and behavioral dysfunctions, i.e. schizophrenia in its various guises, bipolar disorders, obesity, anorexia, drug addiction, and alcoholism. The possibility of using these new modalities to treat a number of cognitive dysfunctions is also under consideration. Because the DBS-CLDBS technology brings about a cross-fertilization between scientific investigation and surgical practice, it will also contribute to an enhanced understanding of brain function.(C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title:  Authentication; Chaotic maps; Cloud computing; Emergency medical care system; Network security; Wireless body area network        
Abstract: Recent advances in medical treatment and emergency applications, the need of integrating wireless body area network (WBAN) with cloud computing can be motivated by providing useful and real time information about patients' health state to the doctors and emergency staffs. WBAN is a set of body sensors carried by the patient to collect and transmit numerous health items to medical clouds via wireless and public communication channels. Therefore, a cloud-assisted WBAN facilitates response in case of emergency which can save patients' lives. Since the patient's data is sensitive and private, it is important to provide strong security and protection on the patient's medical data over public and insecure communication channels. In this paper, we address the challenge of participant authentication in mobile emergency medical care systems for patients supervision and propose a secure cloud-assisted architecture for accessing and monitoring health items collected by WBAN. For ensuring a high level of security and providing a mutual authentication property, chaotic maps based authentication and key agreement mechanisms are designed according to the concept of Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which depends on the CMBDLP and CMBDHP problems. Security and performance analyses show how the proposed system guaranteed the patient privacy and the system confidentiality of sensitive medical data while preserving the low computation property in medical treatment and remote medical monitoring.

Title:  Hydraulic retarder; Heavy-duty vehicles; Temperature rise; Braking torque; Mathematical model        
Abstract: Hydraulic retarders are auxiliary braking devices that reduce the velocity of a vehicle, particularly when a vehicle is driven downhill. Such velocity reduction could reduce the potential risk caused by brake failure caused by the service brake working for a long time and the temperature of the brake shoe becomes extremely high. This paper introduces the construction of the hydraulic retarder and proposes two mathematical models for the hydraulic retarder. The first mathematical model is deduced by using fluid mechanics, which is used to analyze the mechanism of how braking torque is produced and the key factors that can influence the value of the braking torque. The second mathematical model is deduced by using thermodynamics, which is used to quantify the heat produced by the hydraulic retarder. This research emphasizes that the flow rate and the average velocity of the working fluid in the working chamber mainly determine the braking torque of the hydraulic retarder. The flow rate into and out of the working chamber determines the temperature rise of the working fluid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted with the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulent models. Experiments are carried out to justify the two mathematical models and the CFD simulations. The results show that the mathematical models are capable of describing the force analysis and energy conversion of the hydraulic retarder and SST is more accurate for CFD simulation and the error is within 6 %.

Title:  Sphingosine-1-phosphate; Sphingosine kinase; Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase; Sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase; S1P receptor; Lung diseases        
Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP), a simple, bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, plays a key role, both intracellularly and extracellularly, in various cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, migration, inflammation, angiogenesis, and endothelial barrier integrity. The cellular S1P level is low and is tightly regulated by its synthesis and degradation. Sphingosine Kinases (SphKs) 1 and 2, catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of sphingosine to S1P, while the degradation is mediated by the reversible dephosphorylation catalyzed by the S1P phos-phatases and lipid phosphate phosphatases and the irreversible degradation to hexadecenal and ethanolamine phosphate by sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (S1PL). As a ligand for specific G-protein-coupled receptors, S1P(1-5), which are differentially expressed in different cell types, S1P generates downstream signals that play crucial role in developmental and disease related pathologies. In addition to acting extracellularly on receptors located on the plasma membrane, S1P can also act intracellularly, independently of S1P(1-5), affecting calcium homeostasis and cell proliferation. The SphKs /S1P /S1PL metabolic pathway is implicated in numerous human pathologies including respiratory disorders, thereby raising the possibility that manipulating intracellular S1P levels could offer therapeutic potential in ameliorating lung diseases. This review focuses on the prospects of targeting S1P signaling and S1P metabolizing enzymes using small molecule inhibitors, receptor agonists, and antagonists in the treatment of lung diseases.

Abstract: In this letter, Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) delay Doppler maps (DDMs) acquired by the U.K. TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) mission are analyzed to identify sea ice infesting waters in circumpolar areas. First, the sensitivity of actual DDM to sea ice is investigated using reference information provided by a Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery and a Special Sensor Microwave/Imager based sea-ice concentration map. Then, a new product is proposed that consists of normalized radar cross section measurements derived from actual DDMs and arranged in gridded format. This product is shown to provide spatial information on the sea ice transition that cannot be obtained exploiting the conventional DDM product. Hence, this new product can be used to improve/complement conventional remote sensing techniques for sea ice observation.

Title:  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2; muramyl dipeptide; peptidoglycan; innate immunity; leucine-rich repeat domain; surface plasmon resonance        
Abstract: Genetic mutations in the innate immune receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2 (Nod2) have demonstrated increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that is hypothesized to be accompanied by changes in the gut microbiota. Nod2 responds to the presence of bacteria, specifically a fragment of the bacterial cell wall, muramyl dipeptide (MDP). The proposed site of this interaction is the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular modeling were used to investigate the interaction of the LRR domain with MDP. A functional and pure LRR domain was obtained from Escherichia coli expression in high yield. The LRR domain binds to MDP with high affinity, with a K-D of 212 +/- 24 nM. Critical portions of the receptor were determined by mutagenesis of putative binding residues. Fragment analysis of MDP revealed that both the peptide and carbohydrate portion contribute to the binding interaction.

Title:  gravitation; methods        
Abstract: The reproducibility of experiments is one of the main principles of the scientific method. However, numerical N-body experiments, especially those of planetary systems, are currently not reproducible. In themost optimistic scenario, they can only be replicated in an approximate or statistical sense. Even if authors share their full source code and initial conditions, differences in compilers, libraries, operating systems or hardware often lead to qualitatively different results. We provide a new set of easy-to-use, open-source tools that address the above issues, allowing for exact (bit-by-bit) reproducibility of N-body experiments. In addition to generating completely reproducible integrations, we show that our framework also offers novel and innovative ways to analyse these simulations. As an example, we present a high-accuracy integration of the Solar system spanning 10 Gyr, requiring several weeks to run on a modern CPU. In our framework, we can not only easily access simulation data at predefined intervals for which we save snapshots, but at any time during the integration. We achieve this by integrating an on-demand reconstructed simulation forward in time from the nearest snapshot. This allows us to extract arbitrary quantities at any point in the saved simulation exactly (bit-by-bit), and within seconds rather than weeks. We believe that the tools we present in this paper offer a new paradigm for how N-body simulations are run, analysed and shared across the community.

Title:  Computer science education; Integrated text-books; Programming; Learner performance        
Abstract: We describe the evolution of an introductory programming course into an active learning format, thereby replacing the traditional textbook and online tutoring system with an integrative version. We find a strong positive correlation between the student achievement scores in the integrated online textbook exercises and quizzes as well as overall course achievement. However, we observe that the comparable performance is not across all learning assessment categories when comparing subsequent course offerings. Particularly, we note slightly lower average performance for programming assignments and quizzes in the flipped classroom offering. For this active learning format offering, we perceive that performing students have a higher average score in the interactive textbook environment and skipped fewer overall assignments than the lower performing learners. We additionally find that students performing well in the online self guided hands on programming exercises perform significantly better than their lower performing peers.

Abstract: This article is an overview of current research in the area of sulfate activation. Emphasis is placed on. presenting unresolved issues in an appropriate context for critical evaluation by the reader. The energetics of sulfate activation is reevaluated in light of recent findings that demonstrate that the synthesis of activated sulfate is thermodynamically driven by GTP hydrolysis. The structural and functional bases of this GTPase activation are discussed in detail. The bonding and hydrolysis of the high-energy, phosphoric-sulfuric acid anhydride bond of activated sulfate are presented along with an analysis of the importance of the divalent cation and pyrophosphate protonation in the equilibria governing activated sulfate formation. The molecular genetics of sulfate assimilation in prokaryotes is reviewed with an emphasis on the regulation of the pathway. Recent discoveries connecting sulfate activation to plant/microbe symbiogenesis are presented, as are several examples of the importance of activated sulfate in human metabolism and disease.

Title:  Rainwater harvesting; Urban runoff; Rainfall concentration; Urban drainage management; Rainfall-runoff equation; Khartoum        
Abstract: Runoff water management is among the inherent challenges which face the sustainability of the development of arid urban centers. These areas are particularly at risk from flooding due to rainfall concentration in few heavy showers. On the other hand, they are susceptible to drought. The capital of Sudan (Khartoum) stands as exemplary for these issues. Hence, this research study aims at investigating the potential of applying rainwater harvesting (RWH) in Khartoum City Center as a potential urban runoff management tool. Rapid urbanization coupled with the extension of impervious surfaces has intensified the heat island in Khartoum. Consequently, increased frequency of heat waves and dust storms during the dry summer and streets flooding during the rainy season have led to environmental, economical, and health problems. The study starts with exposing the rainfall behavior in Khartoum by investigating rainfall variability, number of raindays, distribution of rain over the season, probability of daily rainfall, maximum daily rainfall and deficit/surplus of rain through time. The daily rainfall data show that very strong falls of >30 mm occur almost once every wet season. Decreased intra- and inter-annual rainfall surpluses as well as increased rainfall concentration in the month of August have been taking place. The 30-year rainfall variability is calculated at decade interval since 1941. Increasing variability is revealed with 1981-2010 having coefficients of variation of 66.6% for the annual values and 108.8-118.0% for the wettest months (July-September). Under the aforementioned rainfall conditions, this paper then explores the potential of RWH in Khartoum City Center as an option for storm water management since the drainage system covers only 40% of the study area. The potential runoff from the 6.5 km(2) center area is computed using the United States Natural Resources Conservation Services method (US-NRCS), where a weighted Curve Number (CN) of 94% is found, confirming dominant imperviousness. Rainfall threshold for runoff generation is found to be 3.3 mm. A 24,000 m(3) runoff generated from a 13.1 mm rainfall (with 80% probability and one year return period) equals the drainage system capacity. An extreme rainfall of 30 mm produces a runoff equivalent to fourfold the drainage capacity. It is suggested that the former and latter volumes mentioned above could be harvested by applying the rational method from 18% and 80% rooftops of the commercial and business district area, respectively. Based on the above results, six potential sites can be chosen for RWH with a total roof catchment area of 39,558 m(2) and potential rooftop RWH per unit area of 0.033 m(3). These results reflect the RWH potential for effective urban runoff management and better water resources utilization. RWH would provide an alternative source of water to tackle the drought phenomenon. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Branchiostoma lanceolatum; Cephalochordate; Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model; Lancelet; Retinoic acid (RA) signaling        
Abstract: Background: During embryogenesis, tight regulation of retinoic acid (RA) availability is fundamental for normal development. In parallel to RA synthesis, a negative feedback loop controlled by RA catabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 subfamily 26 (CYP26) is crucial. In vertebrates, the functions of the three CYP26 enzymes (CYP26A1, CYP26B1, and CYP26C1) have been well characterized. By contrast, outside vertebrates, little is known about CYP26 complements and their biological roles. In an effort to characterize the evolutionary diversification of RA catabolism, we studied the CYP26 genes of the cephalochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma lanceolatum), a basal chordate with a vertebrate-like genome that has not undergone the massive, large-scale duplications of vertebrates. Results: In the present study, we found that amphioxus also possess three CYP26 genes (CYP26-1, CYP26-2, and CYP26-3) that are clustered in the genome and originated by lineage-specific duplication. The amphioxus CYP26 cluster thus represents a useful model to assess adaptive evolutionary changes of the RA signaling system following gene duplication. The characterization of amphioxus CYP26 expression, function, and regulation by RA signaling demonstrated that, despite the independent origins of CYP26 duplicates in amphioxus and vertebrates, they convergently assume two main roles during development: RA-dependent patterning and protection against fluctuations of RA levels. Our analysis suggested that in amphioxus RA-dependent patterning is sustained by CYP26-2, while RA homeostasis is mediated by CYP26-1 and CYP26-3. Furthermore, comparisons of the regulatory regions of CYP26 genes of different bilaterian animals indicated that a CYP26-driven negative feedback system was present in the last common ancestor of deuterostomes, but not in that of bilaterians. Conclusions: Altogether, this work reveals the evolutionary origins of the RA-dependent regulation of CYP26 genes and highlights convergent functions for CYP26 enzymes that originated by independent duplication events, hence establishing a novel selective mechanism for the genomic retention of gene duplicates.

Title:  Nomuraea rileyi; Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT); Vector construction; Hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph); Red fluorescent gene (DsRed2)        
Abstract: An Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system for the entomopathogenic fungus Nomuraea rileyi was established. Three binary T-DNA vectors, pPZP-Hph, pPZP-Hph-RNAi and pPZP-Hph-DsRed2, were constructed. The trpc promoter from Aspergillus nidulans was used as the cis-regulatory element to drive the expression of hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene and DsRed2, which conferred the hygromycin B (Hyg B) resistance and red fluorescence visualization, respectively. The blastospores and conidia were used as the recipients. The blastospores' transformation efficiency reached similar to 20-40 transformants per 10(6) blastospores, whereas the conidia were not transformed. Based on an analysis of five generations of subcultures, PCR and Southern blotting assays, the Ptrpc-hph cassette had integrated into the genomes of all transformants, which contained single copy of the hph gene and showed mitotic stability. Abundant altered morphologic phenotypes in colonies, blastospores and hyphae formations were observed in the arbitrary insertional mutants of N. rileyi, which made it possible to study the relationships between the functions and the interrupted genes over the whole genome. The transformation protocol will promote the functional characterization of genes, and the construction of genetically engineered strains of this important entomopathogenic fungus, and potentially of other similar fungal pathogens.

Title:  Infancy; Primate; Individual differences; Intranasal oxytocin; Cognitive; Development        
Abstract: Exogenous oxytocin administration is widely reported to improve social cognition in human and nonhuman primate adults. Risk factors of impaired social cognition, however, emerge in infancy. Early interventions-when plasticity is greatest-are critical to reverse negative outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that oxytocin may exert similar positive effects on infant social cognition, as in adults. To test this idea, we assessed the effectiveness of acute, aerosolized oxytocin on two foundational social cognitive skills: working memory (i.e., ability to briefly hold and process information) and social gaze (i.e., tracking the direction of others' gaze) in 1-month-old nursery-reared macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We did not predict sex differences, but we included sex as a factor in our analyses to test whether our effects would be generalizable across both males and females. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we found that females were more socially skilled at baseline compared to males, and that oxytocin improved working memory and gaze following, but only in males. These sex differences, while unexpected, may be due to interactions with gonadal steroids and may be relevant to sexually dimorphic disorders of social cognition, such as male-biased autism spectrum disorder, for which oxytocin has been proposed as a potential treatment. In sum, we report the first evidence that oxytocin may influence primate infant cognitive abilities. Moreover, these behavioral effects appear sexually dimorphic, highlighting the importance of considering sex differences. Oxytocin effects observed in one sex may not be generalizable to the other sex.

Title:  Water cooling; concentrated winding; slot cooling; current displacement; flat wire; high power density; traction motor; IPMSM        
Abstract: Electric machines with concentrated winding and single tooth design provide a cost effective way to use flat wires. Hereby high filling factors can be achieved, but due to geometric constraints and the influence of current displacements there remains unused space inside the slot. This space can be used for water cooling channels. As a result of the small thermal resistance between winding and cooling fluid this leads to an outstanding cooling performance. Compared to round wires efficiency is improved in wide parts of the operating area. The absence of the cooling jacket leads to comparable production costs but an even more compact machine design. Technological aspects are discussed and a particular high-power-density interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) with water jacket cooling and round wires is compared to a flat wire wound, slot cooled motor by the use of FEM and CFD simulations and measurements on single tooth specimen.

Title:  Workplace climate; Diabetes care; Safety net providers; Latinos; Chinese Americans        
Abstract: We examine whether workplace climate-quality of staff relationships (QSR) and manageable clinic workload (MCW) are related to better patient care experiences and diabetes care in community health centers (CHCs) catering to Latino and Chinese patients. Patient experience surveys of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and workplace climate surveys of clinicians and staff from CHCs were included in an analytic sample. Comparisons of means analyses examine patient and provider characteristics. The associations of QSR, MCW and the diabetes care management were examined using regression analyses. Diabetes care process were more consistently provided in CHCs with high quality staff relations and more manageable clinic workload, but HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure outcomes were no different between clinics with high vs. low QSR and MCW. Focusing efforts on improvements in practice climate may lead to more consistent provision of important processes of diabetes care for these patients.

Title:  16S; Koala; Microbiome; Gut microbiome; 16SrRNA sequencing        
Abstract: As a dietary source, the foliage of Eucalyptus spp. is low in available protein and carbohydrate while containing polyphenolic compounds that interfere with enzymatic digestion. To overcome this, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) has evolved a range of anatomical and physiological adaptations to assist with digestion and absorption of nutrients from this food source. Microbial fermentation of partially digested eucalyptus leaves is thought to be critical in this process, however, little is known about the composition and diversity of microorganisms that are associated with digestive health in this native species. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing of caecum, colon and faecal pellet samples from two wild, free ranging, Queensland koalas. Our results reveal a highly complex and diverse ecosystem with considerable intra-individual variation. Although samples were dominated by sequences from the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla there was considerable variation at the genus level. This study is the first non-culture based microbiota analysis, using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing, and provides preliminary data to expand our understanding of the koala hindgut.

Title:  Bearingless; control; suspending force; switched reluctance motor (SRM); torque        
Abstract: Recently, bearingless switched reluctance motor (BLSRM) has been received more and more attention. To realize the stable levitation and rotation, the corresponding suspending force and torque should be controlled. In this paper, different from the conventional bearingless SRM control, one independent control scheme for levitation force and torque is presented. In the control, a complex control algorithm based on a lookup table is not needed. Torque control is separated from radial force control, and each channel of radial force is independently controlled. Therefore, the control is very simple to be implemented. First, based on the brief introduction of the BLSRM structure and operating principle, the mathematical relationship of levitation force with respect to current and displacement is derived. Furthermore, the rotor dynamics model, in which levitation force in four degrees of freedom is considered, is established. Based on the given analysis, the digital control system, which includes torque and suspending force, is designed by means of TMS320F28335, and an experimental platform is established. According to the experimental results, the proposed BLSRM can be steadily levitated in the static and rotating conditions.

Title:  Multi-modal intraoperative monitoring; Posterior cervical spine surgery; High cervical operation; Low cervical operation        
Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of multimodal neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring (IOM) in a cohort of patients who underwent posterior cervical surgery. Material and methods: A total 182 patients were included in this study. Multi-modal intraoperative monitoring (MIOM, somatosensory-evoked potentials: SSEP/transcranial motor-evoked potentials: TCe-MEP/spontaneous-electromyography: S-EMG) was performed in a consecutive series of 129 patients and the other 53 patients (control group) did not. We classified all patients into a high-cervical (H-C) operation group or a low-cervical (L-C) operation group, based on the level of the surgery and analyzed respectively. Results: One hundred-eleven cases (86%) showed true negative results. Fourteen patients (9 cases- H-C operation, 5 cases- L-C operation) met the criteria of neurophysiologic changes during operation. Of these, 10 cases were restored to normal during operation spontaneously (7cases) or with surgical manipulation (all 3 cases were related to H-C operation). All unrestored neurophysiologic cases (n = 4) showed new post-operative neurological deficits. Four patients showed neurological deficits without any changes in MIOM (false negative, 3 cases-delayed onset C5 palsy, 1 case-C8 palsy). Conclusions: Proper application of MIOM may be useful to detect intraoperative neurological injury during the posterior cervical operations and improve surgical outcomes especially in subgroup of H-C operation. However, the efficacy of MIOM may be restricted to detect and prevent the delayed onset C5 palsy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Biological matter; viscoelastic materials; sub-diffusion        
Abstract: The proclaimed Century of Biology is rapidly leading to the realization of how starkly different and more complex biological materials are than the materials that underpinned the industrial and technological revolution. These differences arise, in part, because biological matter exhibits both viscous and elastic behavior. Moreover, this behavior varies across the frequency, wavelength and amplitude spectrum of forcing. This broadclass of responsesin biological matter requires multiple frequency-dependent functions to specify material behavior, instead of a discrete set of parameters that relate to either viscosity or elasticity. This complexity prevails even if the biological matter is assumed to be spatially homogeneous, which is rarely true. However, very little progress has been made on the characterization of heterogeneity and how to build that information into constitutive laws and predictive models. In addition, most biological matter is non-stationary, which motivates the term ""living"". Biomaterials typically are in an active state in order to perform certain functions, and they often are modified or replenished on the basis of external stimuli. It has become popular in materials engineering to try to duplicate some of the functionality of biomaterials, e.g., a lot of effort has gone into the design of self-assembling, self-healing and shape shifting materials. These distinguishing features of biomaterials require significantly more degrees of freedom than traditional composites and many of the molecular species and their roles in functionality have yet to be determined.A typical biological material includes small molecule biochemical species that react and diffuse within larger species. These large molecular weightspecies provide the primary structural and biophysical properties of the material. The small molecule binding and unbinding kinetics serves to modulate material properties, and typical small molecule production and release are governed by external stimuli (e.g., stress). The bottom line is that the mathematical and numerical tools of 20th Century materials science are often insufficient for describing biological materials and for predicting their behavior both in vitro and in vivo.

Title:  Allergy conjunctivitis; Immunoregulatory peptide; Toll like receptor 2; Staphylococcal enterotoxin B        
Abstract: Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva, which is characterized by antigen challenge and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activation. Here, a designed small peptide ZY12 was found to contain therapeutic potential in staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced AC model. ZY12 treatment showed the remission of clinical signs, plasma total IgE levels, number of mast cells and the proportion of degranulated mast cell in AC mice. Levels of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) in the lymph nodes or spleen were significantly decreased while those of Th1 cytokine (IFN-gamma were increased in ZY12 treated group, suggesting a protective role of ZY12 in AC by mediating the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokines. Importantly, ZY12 significantly inhibited TLR2 expression in conjunctival tissue. Combined its therapeutic effects with TLR2 inhibitory function, ZY12 might be an ideal candidate for the development of new therapeutic agent for allergic disease. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title:  by-product; ceramic material; low density materials; glass recycling; waste        
Abstract: Recently several innovative suggestions on how industrial wastes can be utilised in new products have been presented in literature, e.g. as filler or additives in concrete, incorporated in ceramic materials to produce glass-ceramics and pavement construction. In this work, metallurgical materials from secondary aluminium scrap processing and glass waste derived from treatments of packaging and fluorescent lamps were considered for fabrication of new ceramic materials using powder technology and sintering process. The effect of composition and heat treatment temperature, on the sintering process and then final properties, were evaluated. The results showed that, with the proper firing temperature, lightweight ceramic materials containing high amount of glass waste and an innovative product resulting from the processing of secondary aluminum (ArgAlum (R)) can be produced. The low water absorption (< 1%), low density (< 2 g/cm(3)) and the good flexural strength (16-20 MPa) associated to relatively low sintering temperatures obtained with the addition of ArgAlum (R)-can be considered as promising initial results to obtain new green building materials.

Title:  NMR resonance assignment; Mal d 1; Apple; Allergen        
Abstract: The major apple allergen Mal d 1 is the predominant cause of apple (Malus domestica) allergies in large parts of Europe and Northern America. Allergic reactions against this 17.5 kDa protein are the consequence of initial sensitization to the structurally homologous major allergen from birch pollen, Bet v 1. Consumption of apples can subsequently provoke immunologic cross-reactivity of Bet v 1-specific antibodies with Mal d 1 and trigger severe oral allergic syndroms, affecting more than 70 % of all individuals that are sensitized to birch pollen. While the accumulated immunological data suggest that Mal d 1 has a three-dimensional fold that is similar to Bet v 1, experimental structural data for this protein are not available to date. In a first step towards structural characterization of Mal d 1, backbone and side chain H-1, C-13 and N-15 chemical shifts of the isoform Mal d 1.0101 were assigned. The NMR-chemical shift data show that this protein is composed of seven beta-strands and three alpha-helices, which is in accordance with the reported secondary structure of the major birch pollen allergen, indicating that Mal d 1 and Bet v 1 indeed have similar three-dimensional folds. The next stage in the characterization of Mal d 1 will be to utilize these resonance assignments in solving the solution structure of this protein.

Title:  privacy; personal health information; high-dimensional datasets; streaming databases; data sharing        
Abstract: One of the biggest challenges to health data sharing is regulations that prohibit the transmission and distribution of Personal Health Information (PHI) even among collaborating organizations. This impedes research and reduces the utility of these datasets. Anonymization can address this issue by hiding PHI while maintaining the analytical utility of the data. Much research has focused on data that is static, independent and complete. Unfortunately, this is not typical of health data. Instead of static, independent tables, health data is in relational databases with multiple high-dimensional tables that are transactional and constantly changing. Data recipients usually receive multiple versions of the database over time. This study reviews literature on anonymization methodologies for large and fast changing high-dimensional datasets, especially health data. Relevant papers are analyzed, categorized and compared in terms of scope, and contributions. Finally, we used the extracted details from our analysis to outline possible research direction for developing a realistic anonymization framework for health data sharing. (c) 2015 The Authors.

Title:  Online social network; Social network analysis; Centrality measures; Software requirements elicitation; Software Engineering        
Abstract: Background: Online social networks share similar topological characteristics as real-world social networks. Many studies have been conducted to analyze the online social networks, but it is difficult to link human interests with social network software design. Purpose: The goal of this work is to propose a methodology involving the analysis of human interactions for use in designing online social network software. Methods: We propose a novel use of social network analysis techniques to elicit requirements in order to design better online Social network-based software. The validation case study involved the collection of real-world data by means of a questionnaire to perform a network design construction and analysis. The key idea is to examine social network to help in the identification of behaviors and interests of people for better software requirements elicitation. Results: The validation case study demonstrates how unexpected centrality measures can emerge in real world networks. Our case study can thus conducted as a baseline for better requirement elicitation studies for online social network software design. This work also indicates how sociometric methods may be used to analyze any social domain as a possible standard practice in online social network software design. Overall, the study proved the effectiveness of the proposed novel methodology for the design of online social network software. The methodology specifically improves upon traditional methods for software design by involving social network modeling and analysis to first study the behavior and elicit requirements to develop more resilient online social network sites.

Title:  Disaster; Women'shealth; Depression; Latent profile analysis; Socioeconomic status; Vulnerable populations        
Abstract: Introduction: Oil spill exposures are associated with increased levels of depression, which is often measured using continuous scores or dichotomous cut points on screening tools in population-based studies. Latent profile analysis can overcome analytic limitations such as 1) masking of heterogeneity in outcomes among people within dichotomous categories and 2) loss of information about symptom patterns among those with the same continuous score. This study examined variation in depressive symptoms and assessed the associations between depressive symptomatology and oil spill exposure, socioeconomic risk factors, and social capital. Methods: Between 2012 and 2014, we interviewed 2852 women in southeastern Louisiana. We performed latent profile analysis then tested the adjusted associations between sociodemographic characteristics, oil spill exposure and latent class membership. Results: Results indicated a three-class solution in which classes varied by symptom severity as the best fit. The strongest associations were among women with the most severe depressive symptoms, who were less educated, were more economically vulnerable, and had the least social support compared to women with no depressive symptoms. Limitations: This study is limited by its cross-sectional design and the self-reported nature of exposures and depressive symptoms, but results are consistent with prior literature. Conclusions: Our results support the conventional use of screening tools to estimate depressive symptomatology. Nevertheless, the identification of subgroups within study participants highlights an important finding: the subgroups were comprised of characteristically different women with varying levels of depressive symptoms, a discovery that would have been overlooked if the CES-D was used conventionally.

Title:  atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease genetics; cardiovascular risk factors; chromosome 9p21; coronary artery disease; modern diagnostics; single nucleotide polymorphism        
Abstract: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with coronary artery disease (CAD) being the single leading cause of death. Better control of risk factors, enhanced diagnostic techniques and improved medical therapies have all substantially decreased the mortality of CAD in developed countries. However, CAD and other forms of atherosclerotic CVD are projected to remain the leading cause of death by 2030 and we face a number of challenges if the outcomes of CAD are to be further improved. The fact that a substantial fraction of high-risk subjects do not reach treatment goals for important risk factors is one of these challenges. At the same time, there is also a non-negotiable fraction of concealed' high-risk subjects who are not detected by current risk algorithms and diagnostic modalities. In recent years, we have started to rapidly increase our knowledge of the framework of common genetics underlying CAD and atherosclerotic CVD in the population. In conjunction with modern diagnostic and therapeutic options, this new genetic knowledge may provide a valuable tool for further improvements in prevention. This review summarizes the recent findings from the search for common genetic risk factors for CAD. Furthermore, the author discusses how such recent findings could potentially be used in a number of clinical applications within CAD prevention, including in clinical risk stratification, in prediction of drug treatment response and in the search for targets for novel preventive therapies.

Title:  Non-verbal Communication; Saudi Sellers; Appearance; Body Language; Trainings        
Abstract: Communication has a major impact on how customers perceive sellers and their organizations. Especially, the non-verbal communication such as body language, appearance, facial expressions, gestures, proximity, posture, eye contact that can influence positively or negatively the first impression of customers and their experiences in stores. Salespeople in many countries, especially the developing ones, are just telling about their companies' products because they are unaware of the real role of sellers and the importance of non-verbal communication. In Saudi Arabia, the seller profession has been exclusively for foreign labor until 2006. It is very recently that Saudi workforce enters to the retailing sector as sellers. The non-verbal communication of those sellers has never been evaluated from consumer's point of view. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the non-verbal communication barriers that customers are facing when dealing with Saudi sellers. After discussing the nonverbal communication skills that sellers must have in the light of the previous academic research and the depth interviews with seven focus groups of Saudi customers, this study found that the Saudi customers were not totally satisfied with the current non-verbal communication skills of Saudi sellers. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to develop the non-verbal communication skills of Saudi sellers by intensive trainings, to distinguish more the appearance of their sellers, especially the female ones, to focus on the time of intervention as well as the proximity to customers.

Title:  Operating systems; software failures; failure causes; correlation        
Abstract: Empirical studies in software reliability have predominantly focused on end-user applications. Given the intrinsic dependency of user programs on the operating system (OS) software, OS failures can severely impact even the most reliable applications. Therefore, it is a major requirement to understand how OS failures occur in order to improve software reliability as a whole. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on OS failure causes, based on 7,007 real failure records collected from different computers running a mass-market operating system. We performed quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate different properties of the OS failures analyzed. The findings indicate that OS services failed more than any other OS failure category. Empirical evidences confirmed the presence of failure correlation in the sample, where both cross-correlation and autocorrelation were found; in particular, causal relationship between different operating system failures was observed.

Title:  autonomic failure; body weight; constipation; heart rate variability; metaiodobenzylguanidine; orthostatic hypotension; Parkinson's disease        
Abstract: Objectives: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) begin to lose weight several years before diagnosis, which suggests weight variation is associated with some factor(s) that precede the onset of motor symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the association of autonomic nervous system with body weight in patients with PD. Materials and methods: The subjects were 90 patients with early de novo PD. We examined the associations of body mass index (BMI) with sympathetic nervous - activity reflected in orthostatic intolerance or cardiac uptake of I-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine and parasympathetic nervous activity reflected in constipation or heart rate variability (HRV). Results: Twelve patients (13.3%) were overweight (BMI>25 kg/m(2)), 62 patients (68.9%) were normal-weight (18.5 <= BMI<25 kg/m(2)), and 16 patients (17.8%) were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/m(2)). Underweight patients had greater disease severity and decrease in blood pressure on head-up tilt-table testing, higher cardiac washout ratio of I-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine, and lower HRV and complained of constipation more often than those with normal-weight or overweight patients. On multiple regression analyses, the correlation of these variables with BMI maintained statistical significance after adjustment for age, sex, symptom duration, and motor subtype. Conclusions: Dysautonomia and disease severity are closely related to body weight independently of age, sex, symptom duration, and motor subtype. Dysautonomia may play a partial role on weight variation in the early stage of PD.

Abstract: Key assays in enzymology for the biochemical characterization of proteins in vitro necessitate high concentrations of the purified protein of interest. Protein purification protocols should combine efficiency, simplicity and cost effectiveness1. Here, we describe the GST-His method as a new small-scale affinity purification system for recombinant proteins, based on a N-terminal Glutathione Sepharose Tag (GST)(2,3) and a C-terminal 10xHis tag(4), which are both fused to the protein of interest. The latter construct is used to generate baculoviruses, for infection of Sf9 infected cells for protein expression(5). GST is a rather long tag (29 kDa) which serves to ensure purification efficiency. However, it might influence physiological properties of the protein. Hence, it is subsequently cleaved off the protein using the PreScission enzyme(6). In order to ensure maximum purity and to remove the cleaved GST, we added a second affinity purification step based on the comparatively small HisTag. Importantly, our technique is based on two different tags flanking the two ends of the protein, which is an efficient tool to remove degraded proteins and, therefore, enriches full-length proteins. The method presented here does not require an expensive instrumental setup, such as FPLC. Additionally, we incorporated MgCl2 and ATP washes to remove heat shock protein impurities and nuclease treatment to abolish contaminating nucleic acids. In summary, the combination of two different tags flanking the N-and the C-terminal and the capability to cleave off one of the tags, guaranties the recovery of a highly purified and full-length protein of interest.

Title:  Ovarian cancer; Early detection markers; CA125; CA15.3; HE4        
Abstract: Background: Ovarian cancer early detection markers CA125, CA15.3, HE4, and CA72.4 vary between healthy women, limiting their utility for screening. Methods: We evaluated cross-sectional relationships between lifestyle and reproductive factors and these markers among controls (n = 1910) from a nested case-control study in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Improvements in discrimination of prediction models adjusting for correlates of the markers were evaluated among postmenopausal women in the nested case-control study (n = 590 cases). Generalized linear models were used to calculate geometric means of CA125, CA15.3, and HE4. CA72.4 above vs. below limit of detection was evaluated using logistic regression. Early detection prediction was modeled using conditional logistic regression. Results: CA125 concentrations were lower, and CA15.3 higher, in post-vs. premenopausal women (p <= 0.02). Among postmenopausal women, CA125 was higher among women with higher parity and older age at menopause (p(trend) <= 0. 02), but lower among women reporting oophorectomy, hysterectomy, ever use of estrogen-only hormone therapy, or current smoking (p < 0.01). CA15.3 concentrations were higher among heavier women and in former smokers (p <= 0.03). HE4 was higher with older age at blood collection and in current smokers, and inversely associated with OC use duration, parity, and older age at menopause (<= 0.02). No associations were observed with CA72.4. Adjusting for correlates of the markers in prediction models did not improve the discrimination. Conclusions: This study provides insights into sources of variation in ovarian cancer early detection markers in healthy women and informs about the utility of individualizing marker cutpoints based on epidemiologic factors.

Title:  infant skin; stratum corneum; Indonesian        
Abstract: Background Although understanding the stratum corneum (SC) of infant skin is important to avoid skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, there has been no such investigation in Indonesian infants to date. Objective To obtain a basic knowledge of SC characteristics in Indonesian infants in order to develop methods for infant-specific skin care and to prevent dermatitis and infection. Methods Seventy-two healthy, full term infants aged 1 to 24 months who were native Indonesians residing in Jakarta were enrolled in this study. Some of the mothers were also enrolled in the study as adults (n=30). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and hydration of the SC (capacitance) on the thigh, buttock, and upper arm were measured after sufficient acclimation in an air-conditioned room, in both infants and mothers. Results The SC hydration was significantly higher in infants than adults at all sites measured, including the buttocks, which is a diaper area. Infant TEWL values were also significantly higher than in adults at all sites. Hydration of the SC and TEWL values showed no significant correlation with age of infant for any site. The SC hydration and TEWL values of Indonesian infants did not decrease to adult values within 24 months, which indicates that the SC characteristics in infants continue to develop after 24 months of age. Conclusion Indonesian infants aged 0-24 months have significantly higher SC hydration and TEWL values than Indonesian mothers. However, infant age has no correlation to SC hydration or to TEWL values. [Paediatr Indones. 2017; 57: 35-40. doi: 10.14238/pi57.1.2017.35-40].

Title:  Shwachman-Diamond syndrome; SBDS; Structural variation; Genomic rearrangement; Non-allelic homologous recombination; Low copy repeat; Whole exome sequencing; Copy number variation; Recessive disease        
Abstract: Background: Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive ribosomopathy caused mainly by compound heterozygous mutations in SBDS. Structural variation (SV) involving the SBDS locus has been rarely reported in association with the disease. We aimed to determine whether an SV contributed to the pathogenesis of a case lacking biallelic SBDS point mutations. Case presentation: Whole exome sequencing was performed in a patient with SDS lacking biallelic SBDS point mutations. Array comparative genomic hybridization and Southern blotting were used to seek SVs across the SBDS locus. Locus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) encompassing flanking intronic sequence was also performed to investigate mutation within the locus. RNA expression and Western blotting were performed to analyze allele and protein expression. We found the child harbored a single missense mutation in SBDS (c.98A >C; p. K33T), inherited from the mother, and an SV in the SBDS locus, inherited from the father. The missense allele and SV segregated in accordance with Mendelian expectations for autosomal recessive SDS. Complementary DNA and western blotting analysis and locus specific PCR support the contention that the SV perturbed SBDS protein expression in the father and child. Conclusion: Our findings implicate genomic rearrangements in the pathogenesis of some cases of SDS and support patients lacking biallelic SBDS point mutations be tested for SV within the SBDS locus.

Title:  ethical consumption; moral psychology; attribution theory; equity theory; prosocial behavior; income; poverty; welfare        
Abstract: This article examines perceptions of low-income consumers receiving government assistance and the choices they make, showing that this group is viewed differently than those with more resources, even when making identical choices. A series of five experiments reveal that ethical purchases polarize moral judgments: whereas individuals receiving government assistance are perceived as less moral when choosing ethical (vs. conventional) products, income earners, particularly high-income individuals, are perceived as more moral for making the identical choice. Price is a central component of this effect because equating the cost of ethical and conventional goods provides those receiving government assistance some protection against harsh moral judgments when choosing ethically. Moreover, earning one's income drives perceptions of deservingness, or the right to spend as one desires. Those who receive assistance via taxpayer dollars are under greater scrutiny (frequently resulting in harsher moral judgments) by others. In addition to influencing perceptions of individual consumers, the results demonstrate that such attributions extend to groups who make ethical choices on others' behalf, and that these attributions have real monetary consequences for nonprofit organizations.

Title:  Levothyroxine; Liothyronine; Serum triiodothyronine        
Abstract: Background: Despite biochemical euthyroidism, some levothyroxine (L-T-4)-treated hypothyroid patients report persisting symptoms and some of these patients are tentatively treated with a combination of L-T-4 and liothyronine (L-T-3). Combination therapy and the appropriate choice of blood tests to monitor treatment are highly debated among specialists and patients. Aim: To evaluate whether measuring serum triiodothyronine (S-T-3) at baseline or during combination therapy can be used as an indicator of a positive effect from L-T-4/L-T-3 combination therapy. Materials and Methods: Observational retrospective study of patients (n = 42) with persisting symptoms of hypothyroidism despite L-T-4 therapy who had normal TSH levels and did not have any comorbidities that could explain their symptoms. All were then treated with L-T-4/L-T-3 combination therapy at a dose ratio of 17/1 according to European Thyroid Association guidelines. Based on patient-reported outcome, they were divided into responders and nonresponders. Results: Five patients were lost to follow-up and thus excluded. At the 3-month follow-up, 11 were classified as nonresponders and 26 as responders. At 12 months these figures had changed to 13 (35%) and 24 (65%), respectively. When comparing responders versus nonresponders, no differences were seen at baseline or during follow-up in S-T-3 and in free T-3 estimates. Further, logistic regression showed no correlation between S-T-3 and free T-3 estimates and responder/nonresponder status. Conclusion: Our data indicate that serum T-3 measurements are not suitable to predict which patient will benefit from L-T-4/L-T-3 combination therapy, and treatment response cannot be followed by repeated T-3 measurements either.

Title:  sinusitis; chronic rhinosinusitis; functional endoscopic sinus surgery; FESS; immunodeficiency; rhinosinusitis; balloon dilation        
Abstract: Background: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors have revolutionized treatment of many inflammatory diseases. Sinusitis after initiation of TNF-a inhibitors has been observed, but has not been well described in the literature. We aim to characterize the clinical features of sinusitis in patients on anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Methods: This is a retrospective chart reviewof 28 patients on a TNF-a inhibitor diagnosed with sinusitis by otolaryngologists at Duke University. Patient demographics, sinusitis characteristics, and treatment course were studied by chart review. Results: The prevalence of sinusitis diagnosed and treated by an otolaryngologist was less than 1%. Of the 28 patients studied, 12 (42.9%) had a history of preexisting sinusitis and 16 (57.1%) had new-onset sinusitis. 71.4% were diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps (CRSsNP), with disease mainly involving the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. No patients hadmajor extrasinus complications or required hospital admission or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. 35.7% (n = 10), including 44% (7/ 16) of new-onset patients required a surgical intervention after initiating anti-TNF therapy. 14.3% (n = 4) of the cohort had improvement in sinonasal symptoms after stopping, changing, or holding doses of the TNF-alpha inhibitor. Conclusion: Anti-TNF-alpha therapy can be associated with new-onset sinusitis, mainly CRSsNP. Overall, the percentage of patients on a TNF-a inhibitor seeking consultation from an otolaryngologist is low. While some patients with new-onset sinusitis will require surgery, modification of anti-TNF-a therapy should be considered as an option in the medical management of these patients.

Title:  obesity; sarcopenia; bone mineral density; heart failure        
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine associations among bone mineral density, osteopenia/osteoporosis, body mass index (BMI), and body composition in patients with heart failure (HF). A total of 119 patients (age = 61 +/- 12 years, 65% male) underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans to determine bone mineral density and body composition. In multivariable linear regressions, BMI, relative skeletal muscle index (RSMI), and mineral-free lean mass were positively associated with total body bone mineral density. Mineral-free lean mass was most strongly associated with bone mineral density ( = .398). In multivariable logistic regressions, higher BMI, RSMI, and mineral-free lean mass were associated with lower odds for osteopenia/osteoporosis. Fat mass was not associated with total body bone mineral density or osteopenia/osteoporosis. These results suggest that muscle mass may be the important component of body mass associated with bone mineral density in patients with HF.

Title:  person perception; masculinity; stereotypes; domestic equality; gender backlash        
Abstract: Men and women who violate traditional expectations with regard to professional status are perceived negatively by others, and can face negative outcomes in the workplace. Here we examine whether these negative perceptions extend to observers' evaluations of status violators' intimate relationships. We employed a fictional scenario depicting a heterosexual married couple, manipulating the professional status of each character while holding all other information constant. Participants (N = 396) projected lower relationship satisfaction onto the husband when he had lower professional status than his wife (nontraditional condition). Participants in this condition also liked and sympathized with the wife less, and perceived her as having more power in the relationship than her husband. Finally, these effects were mediated by ratings of the characters on perceived normative masculinity/femininity. These findings contribute to existing research on the penalties that both male and female gender role violators face, suggesting additional consequences for outsiders' perceptions of their intimate relationships.

Title:  Maize; Transgene; Drought tolerance; ApGSMT2 and ApDMT2        
Abstract: Glycinebetaine plays an important role in the protection mechanism of many plants under various stress conditions. In this study, genetically engineered maize plants with an enhanced ability to synthesise glycinebetaine (GB) were produced by introducing two genes, glycine sarcosine methyltransferase gene (ApGSMT2) and dimethylglycine methyltransferase gene (ApDMT2), from the bacterium Aphanothece halophytica. Southern blotting and RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the two genes were integrated into the maize genome and expressed. The increased expression levels of ApGSMT2 and ApDMT2 under drought conditions facilitated GB accumulation in the leaves of transgenic maize plants and conferred improved drought tolerance. Under drought conditions, the transgenic plants showed an increased accumulation of sugars and free amino acids, greater chlorophyll content, a higher photosynthesis rate and biomass, and lower malondialdehyde and electrolyte leakage compared to the wild-type; these results suggest that GB provides vital protection against drought stress. Under normal conditions, the transgenic plants did not show decreased biomass and productivity, which indicated that the co-expression of ApGSMT2 and ApDMT2 in maize plays an important role in its tolerance to drought stress and does not lead to detrimental effects. It was concluded that the co-expression of ApGSMT2 and ApDMT2 in maize is an effective approach to enhancing abiotic stress tolerance in maize breeding programmes.

Abstract: The Traffic Aware Planner (TAP), developed for NASA Langley Research Center to support the Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) project, is a flight-efficiency software application developed for an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). Tested in two flight trials and planned for operational testing by two commercial airlines, TAP is a real-time trajectory optimization application that leverages connectivity with onboard avionics and broadband Internet sources to compute and recommend route modifications to flight crews to improve fuel and time performance. The application utilizes a wide range of data, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) traffic, Flight Management System (FMS) guidance and intent, on-board sensors, published winds and weather, and Special Use Airspace (SUA) schedules. This paper discusses the challenges of developing and deploying TAP to various EFB platforms, our solutions to some of these challenges, and lessons learned, to assist commercial software developers and hardware manufacturers in their efforts to implement and extend TAP functionality in their environments. EFB applications (such as TAP) typically access avionics data via an ARINC 834 Simple Text Avionics Protocol (STAP) server hosted by an Aircraft Interface Device (AID) or other installed hardware. While the protocol is standardized, the data sources, content, and transmission rates can vary from aircraft to aircraft. Additionally, the method of communicating with the AID may vary depending on EFB hardware and/or the availability of onboard networking services, such as Ethernet, WIFI, Bluetooth, or other mechanisms. EFBs with portable and installed components can be implemented using a variety of operating systems, and cockpits are increasingly incorporating tablet-based technologies, further expanding the number of platforms the application may need to support. Supporting multiple EFB platforms, AIDs, avionics datasets, and user interfaces presents a challenge for software developers and the management of their code baselines. Maintaining multiple baselines to support all deployment targets can be extremely cumbersome and expensive. Certification also needs to be considered when developing the application. Regardless of whether the software is itself destined to be certified, data requirements in support of the application and user interface elements may introduce certification requirements for EFB manufacturers and the airlines. The example of TAP, the challenges faced, solutions implemented, and lessons learned will give EFB application and hardware developers insight into future potential requirements in deploying TAP or similar flight-deck EFB applications.

Title:  Dimensionality reduction; hyperspectral image classification; locally adaptive decision constraints; metric learning        
Abstract: The high-dimensional data space generated by hyperspectral sensors introduces challenges for the conventional data analysis techniques. Popular dimensionality reduction techniques usually assume a Gaussian distribution, which may not be in accordance with real life. Metric learning methods, which explore the global data structure of the labeled training samples, have proved to be very efficient in hyperspectral fields. However, we can go further by utilizing locally adaptive decision constraints for the labeled training samples per class to obtain an even better performance. In this paper, we present the locally adaptive dimensionality reduction metric learning (LADRml) method for hyperspectral image classification. The aims of the presented method are: 1) first, to utilize the limited training samples to reduce the dimensionality of data without a certain distribution hypothesis; and 2) second, to better handle data with complex distributions by the use of locally adaptive decision constraints, which can assess the similarity between a pair of samples based on the distance changes before and after metric learning. The experimental results obtained with a number of challenging hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate that the proposed LADRml algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction and metric learning methods.

Title:  Corn; Yield estimates; Forecast; Optical; Microwave; TerraSAR-X; Radarsat-2; Formosat-2; Spot-4/5; Artificial neural networks        
Abstract: The yield forecasting of corn constitutes a key issue in agricultural management, particularly in the context of demographic pressure and climate change. This study presents two methods to estimate yields using artificial neural networks: a diagnostic approach based on all the satellite data acquired throughout the agricultural season, and a real-time approach, where estimates are updated after each image was acquired in the microwave and optical domains (Formosat-2, Spot-4/5, TerraSAR-X, and Radarsat-2) throughout the crop cycle. The results are based on the Multispectral Crop Monitoring experimental campaign conducted by the CESBIO (Centre d'Etudes de la BIOsphere) laboratory in 2010 over an agricultural region in southwestern France. Among the tested sensor configurations (multi-frequency, multi-polarization or multi-source data), the best yield estimation performance (using the diagnostic approach) is obtained with reflectance acquired in the red wavelength region, with a coefficient of determination of 0.77 and an RMSE of 6.6 q ha(-1). in the real-time approach the combination of red reflectance and C-HH backscattering coefficients provides the best compromise between the accuracy and earliness of the yield estimate (more than 3 months before the harvest), with an R-2 of 0.69 and an RMSE of 7.0 q ha-1 during the development of the central stem. The two best yield estimates are similar in most cases (for more than 80% of the monitored fields), and the differences are related to discrepancies in the crop growth cycle and/or the consequences of pests.

Abstract: Telomere is a ribonucleoprotein structure that protects chromosomal ends from aberrant fusion and degradation. Telomere length is maintained by telomerase or an alternative pathway, known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)(1). Recently, C. elegans has emerged as a multicellular model organism for the study of telomere and ALT(2). Visualization of repetitive sequences in the genome is critical in understanding the biology of telomeres. While telomere length can be measured by telomere restriction fragment assay or quantitative PCR, these methods only provide the averaged telomere length. On the contrary, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can provide the information of the individual telomeres in cells. Here, we provide protocols and representative results of the method to determine telomere length of C. elegans by fluorescent in situ hybridization. This method provides a simple, but powerful, in situ procedure that does not cause noticeable damage to morphology. By using fluorescently labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and digoxigenin-dUTP-labeled probe, we were able to visualize two different repetitive sequences: telomere repeats and template of ALT (TALT) in C. elegans embryos and gonads.

Title:  Irritable bowel syndrome; Poor therapeutic response; Mental health        
Abstract: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) show poor response to treatment. However, risk factors associated with poor therapeutic response have not been determined. This multicenter trial evaluated consecutive outpatients with IBS undergoing treatment for more than 1 month. Mental health status and physical function were evaluated using the Japanese version of the SF-8. Therapeutic response was evaluated using the IBS severity index-Japanese version (IBS-SIJ). Patients with IBS-SIJ scores175 were defined as poor responders to treatment, whereas those with IBS-SIJ scores < 175 were defined as good responders. The demographic and clinical characteristics of these two groups, along with medications, were compared. The study enrolled 131 participants, 75 with IBS-SIJ scores175-56 with IBS-SIJ scores < 175. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that female sex [odds ratio (OR) 2.67, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.19-5.97, p = 0.0167] and mental component summary (MCS) of the SF-8 < 40 (OR 2.58, 95 % CI 1.12-5.97, p = 0.0263) were independent risk factors for poor therapeutic response in patients with IBS. Lower MCS and female sex were risk factors for poor therapeutic response in patients with IBS. Ascertaining the mechanisms by which lower MCS and female sex are associated with poor therapeutic response in IBS may help design better treatments (Trial registration number: UMIN000016804).

Title:  Rain harvesting; Health risk benchmark; Sustainable water practice; QMRA; Relative risk analysis        
Abstract: Health risk concerns associated with household use of rooftop-harvested rainwater (HRW) constitute one of the main impediments to exploit the benefits of rainwater harvesting in the United States. However, the benchmark based on the U.S. EPA acceptable annual infection risk level of <= 1 case per 10,000 persons per year (<= 10(-4) pppy) developed to aid drinking water regulations may be unnecessarily stringent for sustainable water practice. In this study, we challenge the current risk benchmark by quantifying the potential microbial risk associated with consumption of HRW-irrigated home produce and comparing it against the current risk benchmark. Microbial pathogen data for HRW and exposure rates reported in literature are applied to assess the potential microbial risk posed to household consumers of their homegrown produce. A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) model based on worst-case scenario (e.g. overhead irrigation, no pathogen inactivation) is applied to three crops that are most popular among home gardeners (lettuce, cucumbers, and tomatoes) and commonly consumed raw. The infection risks of household consumers attributed to consumption of these home produce vary with the type of produce. The lettuce presents the highest risk, which is followed by tomato and cucumber, respectively. Results show that the 95th percentile values of infection risk per intake event of home produce are one to three orders of magnitude (10(-7) to 10(-3)) lower than U.S. EPA risk benchmark (<= 10(-4) pppy). However, annual infection risks under the same scenario (multiple intake events in a year) are very likely to exceed the risk benchmark by one order of magnitude in some cases. Estimated 95th percentile values of the annual risk are in the 10(-4) to 10(-3) pppy range, which are still lower than the 10(-3) to 10(-1) pppy risk range of reclaimed water irrigated produce estimated in comparable studies. We further discuss the desirability of HRW for irrigating home produce based on the relative risk of HRW to reclaimed wastewater for irrigation of food crops. The appropriateness of the <= 10(-4) pppy risk benchmark for assessing safety level of HRW-irrigated fresh produce is questioned by considering the assumptions made for the QMRA model. Consequently, the need of an updated approach to assess appropriateness of sustainable water practice for making guidelines and policies is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  Systematic mapping study; Software product lines; Software and systems traceability; Software reuse        
Abstract: Context: Traceability in Software Product Lines (SPL) is the ability to interrelate software engineering artifacts through required links to answer specific questions related to the families of products and underlying development processes. Despite the existence of studies to map out available evidence on traceability for single systems development, there is a lack of understanding on common strategies, activities, artifacts, and research gaps for SPL traceability. Objective: This paper analyzes 62 studies dating from 2001 to 2015 and discusses seven aspects of SPL traceability: main goals, strategies, application domains, research intensity, research challenges, rigor, and industrial relevance. In addition to the analysis, this paper also synthesizes the available evidence, identifies open issues and points out areas calling for further research. Method: To gather evidence, we defined a mapping study process adapted from existing guidelines. Driven by a set of research questions, this process comprises three major phases: planning, conducting, and documenting the review. Results: This work provides a structured understanding of SPL traceability, indicating areas for further research. The lack of evidence regarding the application of research methods indicates the need for more rigorous SPL traceability studies with better description of context, study design, and limitations. For practitioners, although most identified studies have low industrial relevance, a few of them have high relevance and thus could provide some decision making support for application of SPL traceability in practice. Conclusions: This work concludes that SPL traceability is maturing and pinpoints areas where further investigation should be performed. As future work, we intend to improve the comparison betWeen traceability proposals for SPL and single-system development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Phylogenetic mixture models; Identifiability; Tropical geometry; Disentangling number        
Abstract: We prove identifiability of the tree parameters of the 3-class Jukes-Cantor mixture model. The proof uses ideas from algebraic statistics, in particular: finding phylogenetic invariants that separate the varieties associated to different triples of trees; computing dimensions of the resulting phylogenetic varieties; and using the disentangling number to reduce to trees with a small number of leaves. Symbolic computation also plays a key role in handling the many different cases and finding relevant phylogenetic invariants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Suspension bridge; Continuum model; Free vibration; Hanger extensibility; Girder continuity at towers; Dimensionless parameters; Natural frequencies        
Abstract: An improved continuum model of three-span suspension bridges has been developed to study the effects of hanger extensibility on free vertical vibrations. This model can be applied to both hinged and continuous girders. To obtain the equations of motion, coupled differential equations describing the vertical deflections of the main cable and the girder are derived with dimensionless parameters. Following the Galerkin method, with shape functions for the main cable and for hinged and continuous girders, equations of motion are obtained in matrix form. A compatibility equation is used to eliminate the additional horizontal force of the main cable in the equations. Natural frequencies of hinged and continuous suspension bridges are evaluated as a function of six dimensionless parameters: the relative elastic bending stiffness of the girder, the relative elastic axial stiffness of the main cable, the relative elastic axial stiffness of the hangers, the relative mass of the girder, the relative length of the side span, and the ratio of the main span sag to the maximum hanger length. Parametric studies are conducted in which each of these parameters is varied individually to observe its effect on the natural frequencies and to identify differences between a conventional model with inextensible hangers and the improved model with extensible hangers. It is found that hanger extensibility affects the natural frequencies and mode shapes of higher modes for suspension bridges with a large relative girder stiffness. This effect is slightly more pronounced for antisymmetric modes and continuous bridges. In addition, even for a bridge with a large relative girder stiffness, the hanger extensibility rarely affects the natural frequencies of higher modes if the bridge either has a large relative mass of the girder or a large relative length of the side span.

Title:  school leadership; undocumented students; ethics; education policy; immigration policy        
Abstract: Purpose: If Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) takes place in a community near school property, maintaining a school environment conducive to learning can be difficult. This article examines (a) how a school leader and personnel perceived the impact that ICE activity in their community had on students and families and (b) whether school personnel incorporated community concerns in their response, and if they exhibited an ""ethic of community.""Research Methods/Approach: Data come from an embedded case study of 14 educators in a school that experienced ICE activity close to school grounds in 2008. Findings: The principal and other school personnel tried to minimize the impact that uncertainty over ICE's presence in the neighborhood could have on the school environment, and took steps to limit the short-term and long-term effects on the community. Personnel demonstrated that prioritizing relationships, dialogue, and collaboration with undocumented community members was central to their decision-making process. Implications for Research and Practice: School leaders and practitioners may not know their legal and/or ethical responsibilities toward undocumented students-or anticipate contexts related to the legal status of students' family members. This article highlights the need for schools and school districts to create policies and resources to protect undocumented students' educational rights and ensure that personnel receive training on those policies. Research can expand understanding of how personnel respond to the sensitive personal and legal contexts involving undocumented families.

Title:  Arrhythmia; genetics; hot bath; next-generation sequencing; sudden unexpected death        
Abstract: We report a case of sudden unexpected death of a young woman who was found in a bathtub of hot water. The autopsy concluded that all possible causes of sudden loss of consciousness, except cardiac origin, could be excluded. However, the heart did not show any obvious pathological changes. We used next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) to examine 73 genes and detected 3 rare, potentially pathogenic variants with minor allele frequencies <= 1.0%. The pathogenicity of these variants was evaluated using 8 in silico predictive algorithms, and SCN5A_p. Gly289Ser, CACNB2_p. Ser502Leu, and MYH11_p.Lys1573Glu were detected as possible pathogenic variants. Inherited heart disease is a likely cause of sudden unexpected deaths of young people in hot baths, even before the clinical manifestation of the disease. In the future, molecular analysis by NGS may help to predict young to early middle-aged people who could be at risk of sudden arrhythmogenic fatality in hot baths.

Title:  Urban greening; system design; water requirements; scheduling        
Abstract: Living walls (LW) are innovative Urban Greening systems that represent a promising tool for sustainable construction and bioclimatic design. LW use a growing media to support plant establishment and growth in a vertical plane. A drip irrigation system is mandatory to be installed to supply water and nutrients to plants. As the number of LW installed in urban areas is rapidly growing, it is important to conduct studies to optimize irrigation water use. This work has therefore two main objectives: (i) optimizing irrigation scheduling in a non-recirculating outdoor LW installed near Seville (SE Spain), and (ii) assessing LW daily water needs over the summer period. The experimental setup consisted of two 2x1 m multilayer LW modules with a plant density of 36 plants m(-2). Each module consisted of two geotextile layers sewn together and forming 15x15 cm pockets, and a waterproof layer facing the wall. The system is attached to the wall by means of a metal profile. The drip irrigation system consisted of a PE drip line placed in the upper part of the LW with drippers spaced 15 cm. Water losses by drainage (i.e. runoff) were collected with a semi-circular gutter placed at the bottom of each LW module. Both water applied and water lost by drainage were recorded for each irrigation event with a volumetric water meter and rain gauge, respectively. The main microclimatic variables (solar radiation, air temperature and relative humidity) were also recorded. The runoff hydrographs obtained for three different emitter discharge rates (2, 4 and 8 I/h), as well as the estimated LW water requirements are presented and discussed. The results indicate that, for lost solution systems, pulse drip irrigation is more suitable than applying irrigation times that maximize water distribution. Living Wall evapotranspiration was highly correlated with reference evaportranspiration, which allowed to derive a mean garden coefficient of 0.75.

Title:  ankle; CT; MRI; os sustentaculum; talocalcaneal coalition        
Abstract: OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to retrospectively determine the prevalence and image findings of extraarticular talocalcaneal coalition with os sustentaculum, a type of talocalcaneal coalition that does not appear in current classification systems, in patients with an imaging diagnosis of foot coalition. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study was performed using a database query of radiology reports of ankle and foot CT or MRI examinations performed from August 2001 to November 2013. Eighty-one patients were identified through a keyword search of the database for ""talocalcaneal coalition,"" ""tarsal coalition,"" ""coalition,"" or ""os sustentaculum."" Imaging features of CT or MRI findings were evaluated. Chart review was used to identify demographic information. RESULTS. Extraarticular talocalcaneal coalition with os sustentaculum was diagnosed in 13 patients (nine men, four women), which represents a prevalence of 16.0% (13/81) in all foot coalitions and 24.1% (13/54) in all talocalcaneal coalitions. Four of 13 patients underwent surgical resection, and histology was obtained in three patients. Nine patients who had no history of trauma were symptomatic and all patients with bone marrow edema at the coalition sites on MRI (n = 5) were also symptomatic. Coexisting extraarticular talocalcaneal coalition with os sustentaculum and intraarticular talocalcaneal coalition were observed in 11 of 13 patients. CONCLUSION. The os sustentaculum is a component of extraarticular talocalcaneal coalitions and as such is usually related to the presence of symptoms. If a patient with an os sustentaculum has symptoms in the medial talocalcaneal joint area, an extraarticular talocalcaneal coalition related to the os sustentaculum should be considered.

Title:  wire rope; residual magnetic field; Hilbert-Huang transform; compressed sensing; quantitative recognition        
Abstract: Electromagnetic methods are commonly employed to detect wire rope discontinuities. However, determining the residual strength of wire rope based on the quantitative recognition of discontinuities remains problematic. We have designed a prototype device based on the residual magnetic field (RMF) of ferromagnetic materials, which overcomes the disadvantages associated with in-service inspections, such as large volume, inconvenient operation, low precision, and poor portability by providing a relatively small and lightweight device with improved detection precision. A novel filtering system consisting of the Hilbert-Huang transform and compressed sensing wavelet filtering is presented. Digital image processing was applied to achieve the localization and segmentation of defect RMF images. The statistical texture and invariant moment characteristics of the defect images were extracted as the input of a radial basis function neural network. Experimental results show that the RMF device can detect defects in various types of wire rope and prolong the service life of test equipment by reducing the friction between the detection device and the wire rope by accommodating a high lift-off distance.

Title:  Web semantics architectures; Applications and standards; Metadata and ontologies; Web data integration        
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a four-level architecture that aims at integrating, publishing and retrieving ecological data making use of linked data (LD). It allows scientists to explore taxonomical, spatial and temporal ecological information, access trophic chain relations between species and complement this information with other data sets published on the Web of data. The development of ecological information repositories is a crucial step to organize and catalog natural reserves. However, they present some challenges regarding their effectiveness to provide a shared and global view of biodiversity data, such as data heterogeneity, lack of metadata standardization and data interoperability. LD rose as an interesting technology to solve some of these challenges. Design/methodology/approach - Ecological data, which is produced and collected from different media resources, is stored in distinct relational databases and published as RDF triples, using a relational-Resource Description Format mapping language. An application ontology reflects a global view of these datasets and share with them the same vocabulary. Scientists specify their data views by selecting their objects of interest in a friendly way. Adata view is internally represented as an algebraic scientific workflow that applies data transformation operations to integrate data sources. Findings - Despite of years of investment, data integration continues offering scientists challenges in obtaining consolidated data views of a large number of heterogeneous scientific data sources. The semantic integration approach presented in this paper simplifies this process both in terms of mappings and query answering through data views. Social implications - This work provides knowledge about the Guanabara Bay ecosystem, as well as to be a source of answers to the anthropic and climatic impacts on the bay ecosystem. Additionally, this work will enable evaluating the adequacy of actions that are being taken to clean up Guanabara Bay, regarding the marine ecology. Originality/value - Mapping complexity is traded by the process of generating the exported ontology. The approach reduces the problem of integration to that of mappings between homogeneous ontologies. As a byproduct, data views are easily rewritten into queries over data sources. The architecture is general and although applied to the ecological context, it can be extended to other domains.

Abstract: In recent years, there have been many unexpected events such as earthquake and tsunami in the world. Because of the uncertainty and the damage of the emergency, the time and quantity of material demand in disaster areas are random, the time and quantity to send supplies is also random. In order to solve the problem of random emergency demand, using the method of system simulation, it provides a reasonable solution to the problem of the random demand. In a period of time, through the statistics of daily material consumption in disaster area, deducing the mathematical laws that are generally obeyed, and ultimately calculate the best amount of transmission per day. Combined with an example of the daily distribution of the earthquake relief, using computer programming simulation, getting the best daily amount of transmission.

Title:  L-carnitine; Lipid peroxidation; Menopause; Oxidative stress        
Abstract: Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant effects of L-carnitine on the oxidative stress parameters in oophorectomized rats. Methods: Twenty-four female albino Wistar rats were used. Rats were divided into four groups: laparotomy-only (LOSALINE) group, oophorectomy plus L-carnitine 100 mg/kg/day (OXL100) group, oophorectomy plus L-carnitine 500 mg/kg/day (OXL500) group, and oophorectomy-only (OXSALINE) group. Experimental protocol was started on day 21 post-castration. Various dosage forms of L-carnitine or isotonic saline were administered intraperitoneally for 14 consecutive days. Nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidative stress (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) were evaluated in the tissues including kidney, liver and heart, and sera. Result(s): In the heart tissue samples, there was no difference in the levels of NO, OSI and TOS between the groups. However, MDA levels in OXSALINE group were significantly higher than OXL500 group. On the other hand, there was no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of levels of NO, MDA, TAS, TOS and OSI in liver, kidney and sera samples. Conclusion(s): Levels of MDA in the heart tissue were significantly higher in OXSALINE group compared to OXL500 group. Thus, it may be suggested that L-carnitine reduces oxidative stress at least in the heart of oophorectomized rats. (C) 2016 Alexandria University Faculty of Medicine.

Title:  Prosocial behavior; Mother-child relationship; Father-child relationship; Teacher-child relationship        
Abstract: Prosocial behavior is considered an important dimension of positive development. Although previous research suggests the quality of children's early relationships may influence prosocial behaviors, the specific contributions of mother, father and teacher to children's prosocial behavior have been less examined. This is a cross-sectional study that investigates (a) the combined associations between mother-, father- and teacher-child relationships, and prosocial behavior in 168 children aged 36-72 months, and (b) the mediating role of the teacher-child relationship in the association between the parent-child relationship and prosocial behavior. Results suggested a positive link between the quality of relationships with early caregivers and children's prosocial behavior. The quality of both father- and teacher-child relationships were found to have a direct association with children's prosocial behavior. The quality of the mother-child relationship was indirectly linked to children's prosocial behavior, via the teacher-child relationship. Results suggesting connections between multiple relational contexts were discussed based on the notion of internal working models proposed by attachment theory. Mothers' and fathers' contributions to children's prosocial behavior were also discussed considering differences on relational styles and changing roles of mothers and fathers from dual-earner families.

Title:  angioedema; bradykinin; C1 inhibitor; renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers        
Abstract: Angioedema and urticaria often constitute a challenge in daily clinical practice. They may either co-occur or present as independent conditions. They are characterized by a complex pathomechanism, and their symptoms may be triggered by diverse factors. These differences are crucial for developing a successful treatment regimen. Both conditions may have an allergic origin (immunoglobulin [Ig] E and non-IgE-related), usually induced by histamine, or a nonallergic one, such as bradykinin-mediated angioedema in patients with C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency or angioedema induced by certain drugs (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Currently, we distinguish 5 types of nonallergic angioedema: hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1-INH deficiency, acquired angioedema (AAE), and angioedema induced by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, all of which are mediated by bradykinin, as well as pseudoallergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema (eg, laryngeal angioedema) may be life-threatening because of resistance to corticosteroids and antihistamine drugs. C1-INH concentrates are the drugs of choice in the treatment of HAE and AAE. In recent years, some new drugs have been introduced in the treatment of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, such as bradykinin B-2-receptor antagonist, icatibant, and kallikrein inhibitor, ecallantide, which allow to improve treatment outcomes.

Title:  Korea; Closing; Last-minute concerns; Communication in primary-care settings; Nonverbal resources; Conversation analysis        
Abstract: Although patients may raise new concerns during any time of the medical visit, the closing phase of the consultation is a critical locus for the negotiation of the topicalization of additional concerns. Using conversation analysis as the primary method of analysis, this study provides an analysis of the structure of consultation ""closings"" in Korean primary-care encounters and the way in which the organization of closings in this context discourages patients' presentation of additional concerns. Data are drawn from 60 videotaped primary-care encounters collected from Korea, between 2007 and 2008. The rare occasions in which last-minute concerns are raised are closely analyzed to reveal that the organization of gaze and body orientation play an important role in foreclosing the presentation of additional concerns. The results contribute to our understanding of closings in the primary-care interview by investigating a non-western setting that includes an investigation of an understudied subject - that of embodied resources - and shows how these closings serve the doctor's purpose of bringing closure in the face of last-minute concerns broached by the patient. The cultural meaning of gaze in the Korean medical care context is also discussed. The findings have implications for research on nonverbal communication, cultural differences, and interactions in medical care. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  13Cr4Ni steel; Nitrogen ion implantation; Cavitation erosion; Surface roughness        
Abstract: Nitrogen ions (N+) with five different energies (100-600 keV) were implanted on the 13Cr4Ni steel (base) samples under high vacuum at temperature <100 degrees C. The base and implanted samples were also annealed at 600 degrees C for 6 h at high vacuum (similar to 10(-9) bar). Energy dependent change in structure and mechanical properties of implanted samples were observed after annealing process. Structural study suggested formation of nitrides and implantation induced surface segregation of nitrogen. The nano-indentation hardness and elastic modulus were increased from 5 to 13 and 183 to 314 GPa respectively with increasing N+ energy. The N+ implantation process had significantly enhanced the cavitation erosion resistance of the base steel. The minimum cumulative weight loss and maximum erosion resistance were obtained for the sample implanted at 600 keV energy. The roughness values of surfaces at various erosion periods were correlated with erosion process to understand erosion mechanism. The lowest roughness values (R-a = 164.42 nm, R-q = 214.75 nm) after 12 h of cavitation erosion test were obtained for the sample implanted at 600 keV energy.

Title:  adverse events; cerebral hemorrhage; hallucinations; neuropsychiatric disorders; quetiapine; seizures        
Abstract: Quetiapine is a low-affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in children and adolescents by the Food and Drug Administration, but not by European Medicine Agency. Although knowledge of adverse drug reactions in children and adolescents is scarce, quetiapine is increasingly being used for youth in Denmark. The aim of this case study is to discuss adverse drug events (ADEs) spontaneously reported to the Danish Medicines Agency on quetiapine used in the pediatric population in relation to adversive drug reactions (ADRs) reported in the European Summary of Product Characteristics (SPCs). The ADE report database at Danish Medicines Agency was searched for all quetiapine ADRs involving individuals (< 18 years) in the period 1997-2015. Fifteen ADE case reports were retrieved, scrutinized, and categorized. The average age was 14.8 years (range 10-17 years) and six patients were boys. The main reported ADEs were (i) endocrine, for example, hyperprolactinemia and hyperthyroidism, (ii) cardiac, for example, tachycardia and QT prolongation, (iii) neurological, for example, seizures and cerebral hemorrhage, and (iv) psychiatric, for example, hallucinations. As some of the reported ADEs are life threatening and not listed as ADRs in the SPCs, off-label use of quetiapine in children and adolescents gives rise to safety concerns.

Title:  Urban harvest approach; Water management; Urban water; Water cycle; Household water demand; Residential water consumption        
Abstract: Earlier results indicated that, for an average household, self-sufficiency in water supply can be achieved by following the Urban harvest Approach (UHA), in a combination of demand minimization, cascading and multi-sourcing. To achieve these results, it was assumed that all available local resources can be harvested. In reality, however, temporal, spatial and location-bound factors pose limitations to this harvest and, thus, to self-sufficiency. This article investigates potential spatial and temporal limitations to harvest local water resources at building level for the Netherlands, with a focus on indoor demand. Two building types were studied, a free standing house (one four-people household) and a mid-rise apartment flat (28 two-person households). To be able to model yearly water balances, daily patterns considering household occupancy and presence of water using appliances were defined per building type. Three strategies were defined. The strategies include demand minimization, light grey water (LGW) recycling, and rainwater harvesting (multi-sourcing). Recycling and multi-sourcing cater for toilet flushing and laundry machine. Results showed that water saving devices may reduce 30% of the conventional demand. Recycling of LGW can supply 100% of second quality water (D-Q2) which represents 36% of the conventional demand or up to 20% of the minimized demand. Rainwater harvesting may supply approximately 80% of the minimized demand in case of the apartment flat and 60% in case of the free standing house. To harvest these potentials, different system specifications, related to the household type, are required. Two constraints to recycle and multi-source were identified, namely i) limitations in the grey water production and available rainfall; and ii) the potential to harvest water as determined by the temporal pattern in water availability, water use, and storage and treatment capacities.

Title:  guidance; treatment adherence; predictors; Internet intervention; work-related stress; stress management        
Abstract: Background: Nonadherence to treatment is a prevalent issue in Internet interventions. Guidance from health care professionals has been found to increase treatment adherence rates in Internet interventions for a range of physical and mental disorders. Evaluating different guidance formats of varying intensity is important, particularly with respect to improvement of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Identifying predictors of nonadherence allows for the opportunity to better adapt Internet interventions to the needs of participants especially at risk for discontinuing treatment. Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of different guidance formats (content-focused guidance, adherence-focused guidance, and administrative guidance) on adherence and to identify predictors of nonadherence in an Internet-based mobile-supported stress management intervention (ie, GET. ON Stress) for employees. Methods: The data from the groups who received the intervention were pooled from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of the same Internet-based mobile-supported stress management intervention (N=395). The RCTs only differed in terms of the guidance format (content-focused guidance vs waitlist control, adherence-focused guidance vs waitlist control, administrative guidance vs waitlist control). Adherence was defined by the number of completed treatment modules (0-7). An ANOVA was performed to compare the adherence rates from the different guidance formats. Multiple hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate predictors of nonadherence, which included gender, age, education, symptom-related factors, and hope for improvement. Results: In all, 70.5% (93/132) of the content-focused guidance sample, 68.9% (91/132) of the adherence-focused guidance sample, and 42.0% (55/131) of the participants in the administrative guidance sample completed all treatment modules. Guidance had a significant effect on treatment adherence (F2,392=11.64, P<.001; omega(2)=.05). Participants in the content-focused guidance (mean 5.70, SD 2.32) and adherence-focused guidance samples (mean 5.58, SD 2.33) completed significantly more modules than participants in the administrative guidance sample (mean 4.36, SD 2.78; t(223)=4.53, P<.001; r=.29). Content-focused guidance was not significantly associated with higher adherence compared to adherence-focused guidance (t262=0.42, P=.67; r=.03). The effect size of r=.03 (95% CI-0.09 to 0.15) did not pass the equivalence margin of r=.20 and the upper bound of the 95% CI lay below the predefined margin, indicating equivalence between adherence-focused guidance and content-focused guidance. Beyond the influence of guidance, none of the predictors significantly predicted nonadherence. Conclusions: Guidance has been shown to be an influential factor in promoting adherence to an Internet-based mobile-supported stress management intervention. Adherence-focused guidance, which included email reminders and feedback on demand, was equivalent to content-focused guidance with regular feedback while requiring only approximately a quarter of the coaching resources. This could be a promising discovery in terms of cost-effectiveness. However, even after considering guidance, sociodemographic, and symptom-related characteristics, most interindividual differences in nonadherence remain unexplained.

Title:  Acute Leukemia; Antifungal Drugs; Cancer; Neutropenia; Pediatric        
Abstract: Background: Pediatric patients on chemotherapy are vulnerable to invasive fungal infection especially Candida spices. Resistance to antifungal agents has increased in Candida spp., especially in non-albicans species. This study aims to assess the susceptibility of Candida spp. strains isolated from children with acute leukemia less than 18 years. Materials and Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted during March 2011 to March 2012. Participants were 188 children aging from 1 month to 18 years, who had acute leukemia, were admitted in Amir Oncology Hospital affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Science, Shiraz, Iran. Identification of Candida strains was performed using germ tube and chlamydospore production tests on an Application Programming Interface (API) 20 C AUX yeast identification system. Susceptibility testing for 7 antifungal agents was performed by the agar-based E-test method. Fungal cultures were carried out from nose, oropharynx, stool, and urine specimens. Results: A total of 229 yeasts were isolated. C. albicans was the most common species found, followed by C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and other Candida species. Candida glabrata was the most highly resistant of the yeasts isolated, being 100% resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole, 88% to posaconazole, and 75% to amphotericin B and ketoconazole. Conclusion: In this study, caspofungin was the most effective antifungal agent against the colonized Candida spp. found, followed by conventional amphotericin B. Knowledge about susceptibility patterns of colonized Candida spp. can be of help to clinicians managing pediatric patients on chemotherapy.

Title:  Orthopedic; Analgesic; Anti Inflammatory; Hydroxypropyl Beta Cyclodextrin; XRPD; SEM        
Abstract: Aceclofenac is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug which is widely used in orthopedics for the effective management of pain and inflammation. It shows poor water solubility and short half-life (4 hours). To improve its bioavailability aceclofenac hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) complex was prepared and then characterized for improving the solubility, dissolution and overall improvement in analgesic and anti inflammatory activity. The aceclofenac was complexed with HP-beta-CD by kneading method and then its 3 fractions were coated with PVP for different time. The proper mixture of dispersion was used for the potential therapeutic activity. The prepared aceclofenac HP-beta-CD complex showed more than 4 fold improvement in solubility (0.41 +/- 0.06 mg/mL of aceclofenacHP-beta-CD complex against 0.10 +/- 0.01 mg/mL of pure drug). The FTIR and XRPD confirmed the complex formation and amorphization of drug, respectively. The aceclofenac: HP-beta-CD inclusion complex showed better dissolution profile than pure drug aceclofenac. The pure drug aceclofenac showed a drug release of 28.02% at the end of 12 h. On the other hand the aceclofenac HP-beta-CD complex showed 89.29% drug release after 12 h. The cyclodextrin complex showed 59.34% analgesia as compared to the 56.04% analgesia shown by the standard oral tablet formulation. The anti inflammatory activity was 90.09 +/- 1.02 and 92.22 +/- 1.05% in terms of % inhibition of rat paw edema at the end of 24 h for standard and test, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the aceclofenac HP-beta-CD complex may serve as the prolonged drug delivery system along with PVP coating for the effective management of orthopedic pain and inflammation.

Title:  reflex epilepsy; SYN1 gene mutation; bathing epilepsy; vagal nerve stimulator; autism        
Abstract: Reflex seizures are evoked by a specific afferent stimulus or activity. The pathophysiology of reflex seizures is thought to be hyperexcitability of cortical or subcortical neuronal areas that respond to a physiologic stimulus in an exaggerated manner. This hyperexcitability could occur due to underlying lesions or genetic abnormalities. We present a 7-year-old Latino boy with epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, developmental impairment, and reflex seizures triggered by water and bathing. His seizures were refractory to antiseizure medications. After multiple trials of medications, a vagal nerve stimulator was placed and desensitization therapy initiated. An epilepsy gene panel test was obtained, which showed a mutation in the SYN1 gene (c.1264C>T het, p.Arg422*). There is only one other publication of a family with SYN1 gene mutation and reflex bathing seizures. Identification of this correlation may be helpful in recognition and treatment of other patients and families with this rare presentation.

Title:  CRISPR-Cas9; Hyperthermia; Genome editing; Mammalian cells        
Abstract: Zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) are the most commonly used genome editing tools. Previous studies demonstrated that hypothermia treatment increased the mutation rates induced by ZFNs and TALENs in mammalian cells. Here, we characterize the effect of different culture temperatures on CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing and find that the genome editing efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 is significantly hampered by hypothermia treatment, unlike ZFN and TALEN. In addition, hyperthermia culture condition enhances genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 in some cell lines, due to the higher enzyme activity and sgRNA expression level at higher temperature. Our study has implications on CRISPR-Cas9 applications in a broad spectrum of species, many of which do not live at 37 degrees C.

Title:  DNA detection; isothermal amplification; real-time LAMP; gold nanoparticles; magnesium pyrophosphate; precipitation-based readout; point-of-care nucleic acid testing        
Abstract: Gold nanoparticles have proven to be promising for decentralized nucleic acid testing by virtue of their simple visual readout and absorbance-based quantification. A major challenge toward their practical application is to achieve ultrasensitive detection without compromising simplicity. The conventional strategy of thermocycling amplification is unfavorable (because of both instrumentation and preparation of thermostable oligonucleotide-modified gold nanoparticle probes). Herein, on the basis of a previously unreported co-precipitation phenomenon between thiolated poly(ethylene glycol)/11-mercaptoundecanoic acid co-modified gold nanoparticles and magnesium pyrophosphate crystals (an isothermal DNA amplification reaction byproduct), a new ultrasensitive and simple DNA assay platform is developed. The binding mechanism underlying the co-precipitation phenomenon is found to be caused by the complexation of carboxyl and pyrophosphate with free magnesium ions. Remarkably, poly(ethylene glycol) does not hinder the binding and effectively stabilizes gold nanoparticles against magnesium ion-induced aggregation (without pyrophosphate). In fact, a similar phenomenon is observed in other poly(ethylene glycol)- and carboxyl-containing nanomaterials. When the gold nanoparticle probe is incorporated into a loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction, it remains as a red dispersion for a negative sample (in the absence of a target DNA sequence) but appears as a red precipitate for a positive sample (in the presence of a target). This results in a first-of-its-kind gold nanoparticle-based DNA assay platform with isothermal amplification and real-time monitoring capabilities.

Title:  Atopic dermatitis; eczema; emollients; filaggrin; food allergy; inflammatory cytokines; interleukin; T helper cells        
Abstract: Several risk factors have been identified that appear to be consistently and strongly associated with the development of atopic dermatitis (AD): a family history of atopy, an inherited genetic predisposition, and active and passive exposure to tobacco smoke. Recent studies also have demonstrated that a simple intervention from birth-the daily application of an emollient moisturizer-seems to protect susceptible infants from the development of AD.

Title:  water sorption; glass transition; thermodynamics; plasticizer; gluten        
Abstract: Relation between the thermodynamic parameters obtained from water sorption isotherms and the degree of reduction in the glass transition temperature (Tg), accompanied by water sorption, was quantitatively studied. Two well-known glassy food materials namely, wheat gluten and maltodextrin were used as samples. The difference between the chemical potential of water in a solution and that of pure water (Delta G(w)(s)), the difference between the chemical potential of solid in a solution and that of a pure solid (Delta G(a)(s)), and the change in the integral Gibbs free energy (Delta G(w)(s)) were obtained by analyzing the water sorption isotherms using solution thermodynamics. The parameter Delta G(w)(s) Delta G(w)(s)s a correlated well with.T-g ( Tg -Tg0; where Tg0 is the glass transition temperature of dry material), which had been taken to be an index of plasticizing effect. This indicates that plasticizing effect of water on foods can be evaluated through the parameter Delta G(a)(s).

Title:  Design optimization; Structural reliability; Random variables; Soil properties; Soil tillage equipment; Optimum safety factors        
Abstract: Reliability integration into tillage machine design process is a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of classical design approaches and to achieve designs with a required reliability level. Furthermore, design optimization of soil tillage equipments under uncertainty seeks to design structures which should be both economic and reliable. The originality of this research is to develop an efficient methodology that controls the reliability levels for complex statistical distribution cases of random tillage forces. This developed strategy is based on design sensitivity concepts in order to determine the influence of each random parameter. The application of this method consists in taking into account the uncertainties on the soil tillage forces. The tillage forces are calculated in accordance with analytical model of McKyes and Ali with some modifications to include the effect of both soil-metal adhesion and tool speed. The different developments and applications show the importance of the developed method to improve the performance of the soil tillage equipments considering both random geometry and loading parameters. The developed method so-called OSF (Optimum Safety Factor) can satisfy a required reliability level without additional computing time relative to the deterministic design optimization study. Since the agricultural equipment parameters are extremely nonlinear, we extended the OSF approach to several nonlinear probabilistic distributions such as lognormal, uniform, Weibull and Gumbel probabilistic distribution laws.

Abstract: This first study deals with the one-dimensional (1D) problem of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by an obstacle coated with a thin ferromagnetic layer. Ferromagnetic materials have nonlinear behavior and are widely used in stealth technology as absorbing coatings. Our objective is the derivation, the stability analysis, and the numerical approximation of effective boundary conditions that permit simulation, at least approximatively, of the effect of the thin layer, avoiding the discretization of Maxwells equations inside this layer.

Title:  SRC; willow; nurseries; cutting force; cutter inclination        
Abstract: The paper presents the results of study regarding influences of cutter inclination on the cutting force in the case of the stems (rods) of energetic willow (Salix Viminalis var. Energo). An original research method is proposed, by the means of original equipment, designed and manufactured in the laboratories of ""POLITECHNICA"" University in Timisoara. The experiments were made with Inger variety at controlled moisture content, 0.025 m diameter of the rods, and a special cutting device integrated in a testing system for strength of materials (Zwick/Roell Z005), which insures cutting speed constant at 0,001667 m.s(-1). Four cutter inclination levels were tested (0, 10, 20, and 30, [sexagesimal degree]). In the same time, the cutting surface quality was observed and the moisture content was controlled. The results from experiments were analyzed for determine the relationship between cutting force and cutter inclination, and, also optimal parameters. The maximum cutting force was used to drive pneumatic system design for the knife of cutting module integrated in complex equipment for sorting and packaging SRC rods in nurseries.

Title:  epidemiology; insomnia; prevalence; referral and consultation; sleep        
Abstract: Background and purpose: To estimate the prevalence of insomnia symptoms and syndrome in the general population, describe the types of self-help treatments and consultations initiated for insomnia, and examine help-seeking determinants. Patients and methods: A randomly selected sample of 2001 French-speaking adults from the province of Quebec (Canada) responded to a telephone survey about sleep, insomnia, and its treatments. Results: Of the total sample, 25.3% were dissatisfied with their sleep, 29.9% reported insomnia symptoms, and 9.5% met criteria for an insomnia syndrome. Thirteen percent of the respondents had consulted a healthcare provider specifically for insomnia in their lifetime, with general practitioners being the most frequently consulted. Daytime fatigue (48%), psychological distress (40%), and physical discomfort (22%) were the main determinants prompting individuals with insomnia to seek treatment. Of the total sample, 15% had used at least once herbal/dietary products to facilitate sleep and 11% had used prescribed sleep medications in the year preceding the survey. Other self-help strategies employed to facilitate sleep included reading, listening to music, and relaxation. Conclusions: These findings confirm the high prevalence of insomnia in the general population. While few insomnia sufferers seek professional consultations, many individuals initiate self-help treatments, particularly when daytime impairments such as fatigue become more noticeable. Improved knowledge of the determinants of help-seeking behaviors could guide the development of effective public health prevention and intervention programs to promote healthy sleep.

Title:  Pseudomonas aeruginosa; carbapenemase; VIM-1; VIM-2; GES-5; Turkey        
Abstract: Worldwide increase in carbapenem resistance and transferable carbapenemases are significant challenges in treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. In this study, investigation of carbapenemase production in carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from clinical specimens in a tertiary hospital was aimed. A total of 84 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were examined. Carbapenem inactivation method (CIM) was used for phenotypic detection of carbapenemase production. The existence of bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(OXA-48), and bla(GES) genes was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subtypes of the detected genes were identified by sequence analysis. Arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) was performed to evaluate the clonal relationship among the isolates. The presence of high-risk clones in carbapenemase producers was investigated by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Three isolates (3.5%) were identified as carbapenemase producers by CIM tests, while PCR tests demonstrated three isolates carrying carbapenemase genes as well. bla(VIM) gene was found in two isolates and bla(GES) gene was found in one isolate. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the carbapenemases were VIM-1, VIM-2, and GES-5. AP-PCR yielded high clonal diversity among the isolates. According to MALDI-TOF MS analysis, none of the carbapenemase-producing strains belonged to the high-risk clones. In conclusion, the presence of VIM-1, VIM-2, and GES-5 type carbapenemases in P. aeruginosa isolates was demonstrated for the first time in our hospital, GES-5 being reported for the second time in Turkey. Our results will lead strategies for controlling the spread of carbapenemases and contribute to epidemiological data from Turkey.

Title:  Markov decision process; Nitrogen fertilizer; Eutrophication; Optimal control; Irrigation reservoirs; Japan        
Abstract: Agriculture intensification through the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers is contributing substantially to the tremendous increases in global food production. However, eutrophication of downstream waters associated with excess nitrate pollutant runoff has become a major environmental concern in agricultural areas. Reservoirs used for irrigation are well-positioned to intercept substantial fertilizer runoff from upslope agricultural fields. The authors hypothesized that such reservoirs can be used to influence the quality of downstream surface water. A Markov decision process was formulated to find optimal operating policies for controlling stochastic agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation. The model was applied to an irrigation reservoir in Japan that is prone to nitrate pollution from upslope green tea plantations. The computational results reveal that, in all nitrate-nitrogen states in which the reservoir storage state is below 10%, the optimal policy is to introduce cleaner water supplements from the upstream reservoir. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate-nitrogen concentration is less than 3 mg/L, the optimal policy would be only to release the irrigation water. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate nitrogen concentration exceeds 5 mg/L, the optimal operation decision is to first release irrigation water from the reservoir before introducing cleaner water supplements. Therefore, the operation of irrigation reservoirs can be optimized to control intercepted agro-fertilizer pollutants from intensive agricultural areas. The developed method for reservoir irrigation operation has the potential to support decision making processes to provide greater protection of the water environment from agrochemical pollution while sustaining the productivity in the intensive agricultural areas.

Title:  Random Boolean networks; Escherichia coli; Time-resolved expression; Bacterial gene regulation; Fis; Hns        
Abstract: Background: Measuring the agreement between a gene expression profile and a known transcriptional regulatory network is an important step in the functional interpretation of bacterial physiological state. In this way, general design principles can be explored. One such interpretive framework is the relationship of digital control, that is, the impact of sequence-specific interactions, and analog control, i.e., the extent of the influence of chromosomal structure. Methods and Results: Here, we present time-resolved gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli's growth cycle as measured by RNA-seq. We extend methods which have been developed for discrete sets of differentially expressed genes and apply them to the wild type and two mutant time-series for which the global transcriptional regulators fis and hns were inactivated. We test our continuous methods using simulated 'expression profiles' generated from random Boolean network dynamics where we observe a clear trade-off between maximum response and level of detail included. In the real time-course expression data, we find strong interdependent changes of digital and analog control during the exponential growth phase and a dominance of analog control during the stationary phase. Conclusions: Our investigation puts forward a simple and reliable method for quantifying the match between time-resolved gene expression profiles and a transcriptional regulatory network. The method reveals a systematic compensatory interplay of digital and analog control in the genetic regulation of E. coli's growth cycle.

Title:  detrusor overactivity; enuresis; pathogenesis; polyuria; sleep        
Abstract: Enuresis was historically viewed as a primarily psychiatric disorder, but this understanding has changed dramatically since the end of the last century, when it became clear that somatic factors, such as nocturnal polyuria as a result of vasopressin deficiency, nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal thresholds, all play a crucial role in enuresis pathogenesis. It has also become clear that enuresis is inherited in the majority of cases, although the correlation between genotype and enuretic phenotype is not straightforward. The standard view of enuresis as being the result of either (i) nocturnal polyuria and high arousal thresholds; or (ii) nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal thresholds has become well-established, but further research now complicates the picture. First, psychological/psychiatric problems are overrepresented in enuresis, and might in a minority of cases have a causal or aggravating role. Second, nocturnal polyuria is not always linked to vasopressin deficiency. Third, nocturnal detrusor overactivity is in itself pathogenetically heterogeneous, and could be linked to constipation. Fourth, the sleep of enuretic children might be deep, but possibly also disturbed (by obstructed airways or a distended or contracting bladder). These children might have high arousal thresholds because of the enuresis instead of the other way around. The same might possibly be said about nocturnal polyuria. Taking these new insights into account, a new model of enuresis pathogenesis is presented, which is more complicated but hopefully also more true than the standard consensus.

Abstract: This paper discusses opportunities as well as constraints of evidence based policy and evidence based practice in education. Expectations held by different strands of the public (policy makers, teachers, parents) are discussed as constraint of the underlying educational research. Furthermore, such expectations constrain the communication between researchers and the public (a case of science communication). These relationships between educational research, evidence based policy and communication between research and the public are exemplified by case studies on three topics: The impact of violent computer games, the relationship between class size and students' learning outcomes and the issue of streaming in public schools.

Title:  Depression; Mood-congruent memory; False memory; Personal relevance; Context        
Abstract: The investigation of veridical mood-congruent memory (MCM) in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been subject of many studies, whereas mood-congruent false memory has received comparatively little attention. The present study examined the influence of valence, personal relevance and the valence of the context of the learning material on true and false MCM in 20 inpatients with MDD and 20 healthy controls. Sixty positive, negative, neutral or personally relevant nouns were either combined with a positive, negative or neutral adjective. Word pairs were presented to participants in a learning trial. In a recognition task, participants had to identify the previously studied word pairs. A MCM effect could not be found for hits. However, in exploratory analyses, word pairs containing personally relevant nouns were more rated towards old by the patient relative to the control group. Furthermore, depressed patients tended to rate items more towards old than controls when the words were presented in a negative new context Results are in line with previous findings in depression research emphasizing the role of mood-congruent false memories for mood disorders.

Title:  Medicare; Younger beneficiaries; Health disparity; Recommended care; Quality of care        
Abstract: Background: Although health disparities have been documented between Medicare beneficiaries based on age (<65 years vs. older age groups), underuse of recommended medical care in younger beneficiaries has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we aim to identify and characterize vulnerabilities of the younger Medicare age group (aged= 75 years) and to explore age group as a determinant of use of recommended care among Medicare beneficiaries. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries who participated in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey between 2001 and 2008 (N = 30,117). Age group characteristics were compared using cross-sectional data at baseline. During follow-up, we assessed the association between age and receipt of recommended care on 38 recommended care indicators, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Follow-up periods differed by component indicator. Results: At baseline, a higher proportion of younger beneficiaries experienced social disadvantage, disability and certain morbidities than older age groups. During follow-up, younger beneficiaries were significantly less likely to receive overall recommended care compared to those 65-74 years of age (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 0.75, 0.70-0.80). In addition, male gender, non-Hispanic black race, less than high school education, living alone, with children or with others, psychiatric disorders and higher activity limitation stages were all associated with underuse of recommended care. Conclusions: Younger Medicare beneficiary status appears to be an independent risk factor for underuse of appropriate care. Support to ameliorate disparities in different social and health aspects may be warranted.

Title:  anxiety disorders; fear; conditioning; instructions; fear extinction        
Abstract: Explicit instructions regarding stimulus-threat associations increase acquisition and extinction of fear in healthy participants. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of contingency instructions on fear acquisition and extinction in patients with anxiety disorders. Patients with various anxiety disorders (N = 104) and healthy comparison participants (N = 93) participated in a differential fear conditioning task (within-subjects design). Approximately halfway through the acquisition phase, participants were instructed about the stimulus-threat association, and approximately halfway through the extinction phase, participants were informed that the unconditioned stimulus (US) would no longer be administered. Outcome measures were: fear-potentiated startle, skin conductance, fearfulness ratings, and US expectancy ratings. Patients demonstrated overall increased physiological and subjective fear responses during acquisition and extinction phases, relative to the comparison group. There were no major differences in fear acquisition and extinction between patients with different anxiety disorders. During acquisition, instructions led to increased discrimination of fear responses between a danger cue (conditioned stimulus [CS]+) and safety cue (CS-) in both patients and comparison participants. Moreover, instructions strengthened extinction of fear responses in the patient and comparison group. Patients and healthy comparison participants are better able to discriminate between danger and safety cues when they have been explicitly informed about cues that announce a threat situation. Considering the analogies between fear extinction procedures and exposure therapy, this suggests that specific instructions on stimulus-threat associations during exposure therapy might improve short-term treatment efficacy. The question remains for future studies whether instructions have a positive effect on extinction learning in the longer term.

Title:  protocol reverse analysis; protocol's hidden behavior; protocol message; protocol software        
Abstract: Reverse unknown protocol's hidden behavior has played an important role in the field of network security. The proposed work takes the captured messages and the binary code that implement the protocol both as the studied object. Dynamic Taint Analysis combined with Static Analysis is used for protocol analyzing. Firstly, monitor and analyze the process of protocol program parses the message in the virtual platform HiddenDisc prototype system developed by ourselves, record the protocol's public behavior, then based on our proposed Hidden Behavior Perception and Mining algorithm, static analyze the protocol's hidden behavior trigger conditions and hidden behavior instruction sequences. According to the hidden behavior trigger conditions, new protocol messages with the sensitive information are generated, and the hidden behaviors are executed by dynamic triggering. HiddenDisc prototype system can sense, trigger and analyze the protocol's hidden behaviors. According to the statistical analysis results, we propose the evaluation method of Protocol Execution Security. The experimental results show that the present method can accurately mining the protocol's hidden behaviors, and can evaluate unknown protocol's execution security.

Title:  Eyewitness testimony; memory accuracy; emotional retelling; factual retelling; memory conformity        
Abstract: People often discuss events they have seen and these discussions can influence later recollections. We investigated the effects of factual, emotional, and free retelling discussion on memory recollections of individuals who have witnessed an event. Participants were shown a video, made an initial individual recall, participated in one of the three retelling conditions (emotional versus factual versus free) or a control condition, and then recalled the event individually again. Participants in the factual and free retelling conditions reported more items not previously recalled than participants in the control condition did, while the emotional condition did not show the same advantage. Participants in all three retelling conditions failed to report more previously recalled items as compared with the control condition. Finally, a memory conformity effect was observed for all three retelling conditions. These findings suggest that eyewitnesses' discussions may influence the accuracy of subsequent memory reports, especially when these discussions are focused on emotional details and thoughts.

Title:  Alzheimer's disease; Transgenic mice; Magnetic resonance imaging; Alzheimer beta-protein; Inflammation        
Abstract: In the present study, we have tested whether MRI T-1 relaxation time is a sensitive marker to detect early stages of amyloidosis and gliosis in the young 5xFAD transgenic mouse, a well-established animal model for Alzheimer's disease. 5xFAD and wild-type mice were imaged in a 4.7 T Varian horizontal bore MRI system to generate T-1 quantitative maps using the spin-echo multi-slice sequence. Following immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, Iba-1, and amyloid-beta, T-1 and area fraction of staining were quantified in the posterior parietal and primary somatosensory cortex and corpus callosum. In comparison with age-matched wild-type mice, we observed first signs of amyloidosis in 2.5-month-old 5xFAD mice, and development of gliosis in 5-month-old 5xFAD mice. In contrast, MRI T-1 relaxation times of young, i.e., 2.5- and 5-month-old, 5xFAD mice were not significantly different to those of age-matched wild-type controls. Furthermore, although disease progression was detectable by increased amyloid-beta load in the brain of 5-month-old 5xFAD mice compared with 2.5-month-old 5xFAD mice, MRI T-1 relaxation time did not change. In summary, our data suggest that MRI T-1 relaxation time is neither a sensitive measure of disease onset nor progression at early stages in the 5xFAD mouse transgenic mouse model.

Title:  familial hemiplegic migraine type 1; migraine; diffusion-weighted MRI; voltage-gated calcium channel; gabapentinoids        
Abstract: Migraine is characterized by severe headaches that can be preceded by an aura likely caused by cortical spreading depression (SD). The antiepileptic pregabalin (Lyrica) shows clinical promise for migraine therapy, although its efficacy and mechanism of action are unclear. As detected by diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) in wildtype (WT) mice, the acute systemic administration of pregabalin increased the threshold for SD initiation in vivo. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mutant mice expressing human mutations (R192Q and S218L) in the Ca(V)2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channel subunit, pregabalin slowed the speed of SD propagation in vivo. Acute systemic administration of pregabalin in vivo also selectively prevented the migration of SD into subcortical striatal and hippocampal regions in the R192Q strain that exhibits a milder phenotype and gain of Ca(V)2.1 channel function. At the cellular level, pregabalin inhibited glutamatergic synaptic transmission differentially in WT, R192Q, and S218L mice. The study describes a DW-MRI analysis method for tracking the progression of SD and provides support and a mechanism of action for pregabalin as a possible effective therapy in the treatment of migraine.

Title:  Product line architecture design; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Crossover operator; Empirical study        
Abstract: The optimization of a Product Line Architecture (PLA) design can be modeled as a multi-objective problem, influenced by many factors, such as feature modularization, extensibility and other design principles. Due to this it has been properly solved in the Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. However, previous empirical studies optimized PLA design using the multi-objective and evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II, without applying one of the most important genetic operators: the crossover. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a feature-driven crossover operator that aims at improving feature modularization in PLA design. The proposed operator was applied in two empirical studies using NSGA-II in comparison with another version of NSGA-II that uses only mutation operators. The results show the usefulness and applicability of the proposed operator. The NSGA-II version that applies the feature-driven crossover found a greater diversity of solutions (potential PLA designs), with higher feature-based cohesion, and less feature scattering and tangling.

Title:  Distance estimation; image processing; image analysis; lane marking detection; vehicle tracking; forward collision avoidance assist system        
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel distance estimation method to build a forward collision avoidance assist system (FCAAS) containing techniques of lane marking detection, vehicle tracking, and distance estimation. First, a lane marking detection technique uses a RANSAC algorithm to extract lines of lane markings, which were previously collected from an inverse perspective mapping image filtered by steerable filters. A Kalman filter then tracks the extracted lines accurately and efficiently. Second, a vehicle tracking technique implements a multiple-vehicle tracking method using a particle filter, which tracks the vehicles detected by an AdaBoost classifier. An improved particle filter is implemented to predict the next movement of a vehicle and spread the particles near the predicted location of the vehicle instead of originally spreading the particles around the current location of the vehicle. Finally, an innovative distance estimation method is derived to estimate the distance between the ego vehicle and the front vehicle. The distance estimation method is verified by setting several standard points in the image, whose locations can be measured according to the regulation of lane markings. As a result, verification of the distance estimation method demonstrates a robust feasibility in reality. The FCAAS shows its potential in particular scenes through many experimental sequences acquired from highways in the real world. In addition, the FCAAS fits the demand of a real-time speed system with a speed of 22 frames/s.

Title:  Phthalate exposure; Gas-phase; Dust; Preschool children; Risk assessment; Child-specific benchmark        
Abstract: Six phthalates - dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di(isobutyl) phthalate (DiBP), di(n-butyl) phthalate (DnBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) - in indoor gas-phase and dust samples were measured in thirty residential apartments for the first time in Chongqing, China. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to estimate preschool children's exposure via inhalation, non-dietary ingestion and dermal absorption based on gas-phase and dust concentrations. Risk assessment was evaluated by comparing the modeled exposure doses with child-specific benchmarks specified in California's Proposition 65. The detection frequency for all the targeted phthalates was more than 80% except for BBzP. DMP was the most predominant compound in the gas-phase (median = 0.91 mu g/m(3) and 0.82 mu g/m(3) in living rooms and bedrooms, respectively), and DEHP was the most predominant compound in the dust samples (median = 1543 mu g/g and 1450 mu g/g in living rooms and bedrooms, respectively). Correlation analysis suggests that indoor DiBP and DnBP might come from the same emission sources. The simulations showed that the median DEHP daily intake was 3.18-4.28 mu g/day/kg-bw in all age groups, suggesting that it was the greatest of the targeted phthalates. The risk assessment indicated that the exposure doses of DnBP and DEHP exceeded the child-specific benchmarks in more than 90% of preschool children in Chongqing. Therefore, from a children's health perspective, efforts should focus on controlling indoor phthalate concentrations and exposures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer people of color (LGBTQ-POC) are regularly exposed to unique and contextual forms of prejudice and stigma, which have been linked to stress and increased likelihood of mental and physical health problems. In order to better understand the experiences of this multiply marginalized population, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 LGBTQ-POC to examine how they describe their experiences with identities, communities, discrimination, and health. Data consisted of verbatim interviews, which were guided by intersectionality theory and minority stress theory and analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Using intersectionality theory, this study addresses the simultaneity of oppressions and the ways in which having different combinations of marginalized identities may impact LGBTQ-POC well-being. Common issues discussed by respondents include disconnect from communities, relationships between identities, coming out, and stress and anxiety. The primary concepts introduced in this study include positive intersectionality and come out stress.

Title:  Ambient intelligence; Fuzzy mixed-integer programming; Location-aware service; Parallel computing        
Abstract: Location-aware services (LAS) are special context-aware services that recommend suitable services to a user based on the user's location. However, considerable uncertainty exists when detecting a user's location. Previous studies have rarely discussed such uncertainty, or emphasized the timeliness and efficiency of such systems. Therefore, a fuzzy collaborative problem solving strategy was used to enhance the performance of a ubiquitous LAS system, measured according to the timeliness of a service and the efficiency of the recommendation process. The uncertainty of detecting a user's location using GPS is first considered by modeling the location and speed of the user with fuzzy numbers. After considering these uncertain parameters, a fuzzy mixed-integer programming problem is formulated to determine the timely service location and path for each user. However, the fuzzy mixed-integer programming problem is not easy to solve. Therefore, a fuzzy collaborative problem solving strategy is used to decompose the fuzzy mixed-integer programming problem into smaller pieces that can be handled by separate processing modules. The most favorable path to a user also leads the user to a region with multiple service locations instead of a single service, to maximize total timeliness. To elaborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an experiment was conducted in downtown Taichung City, Taiwan. Based on the experimental results, the proposed methodology was able to be used to determine a timely service location for a specific user, as revealed by the reduced average waiting time. The proposed methodology also reduced the time necessary to find a timely location and path, which contributed to its enhanced efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  Blackbody radiation; Entropy; Exergy; Infinite-staged Carnot heat engine; Monochromatic photon        
Abstract: The study of radiation exergy has important significance for solar energy and high-temperature engineering. In this paper, several exergy expressions of blackbody radiation were discussed and the differences between Petela's expression of exergy and two other expressions were analyzed. Considering that radiant energy and thermal energy are different, the radiation machine model was established; furthermore, the validity of Petela's formula was indicated by this model. Based on the concept of radiation equivalent temperature, the integral form expression of monochromatic photon exergy was put forward by establishing the infinite-staged Carnot heat engine model. At the same time, an approximate relation between equivalent temperature and radiation wavelength was given. The error of this relation is negligible when calculating the exergy of blackbody radiation within the temperature range of the engineering field. Finally, the monochromatic photon entropy was discussed by considering the infinite-staged Carnot heat engine model, and an expression of photon entropy with integral form was given. The monochromatic photon entropy and exergy proposed in our paper satisfy the thermodynamic relation and can reflect the differences between radiant energy and thermal energy.

Title:  Project manager attributes; project experience; construction management; project manager profiles        
Abstract: The South African construction industry has suffered the loss of many qualified middle-management-level project managers in recent years. This has resulted in many young, inexperienced project managers being forced to manage large complex projects. In addition, senior project managers, who are still practising locally, are too busy to mentor and guide the younger project managers, due to the shortage of professionals in the local industry. This article reports on a study done to identify the most important attributes that influence project success in the South African construction industry, by extracting a list of factors identified in the existing literature and grouping these factors into six main categories. Each category contains six factors. A questionnaire was compiled and distributed via an online survey tool. The data was analysed using statistical methods including concordance and correlation. The results indicated that 'interpersonal factors' was considered the most important category, followed by 'application of theory'. 'Personal contribution' and 'personal character' were considered the least important categories. However, the most important attributing factors were 'communication skills' and 'leadership style', neither of which was listed under the top two categories. In general, a low level of concordance was achieved, confirming the belief that level of knowledge, experience and mutual agreement among participants in the industry is low.

Title:  Cold snap; Heat; Coronary heart disease; Stroke; Heart failure; Climate change; Hospital admissions; Weather        
Abstract: Background: Cold spells and heatwaves increase mortality. However little is known about the effect of heatwaves or cold spells on cardiovascular morbidity. This study aims to assess the effect of cold spells and heatwaves on cardiovascular diseases in a Mediterranean region (Catalonia, Southern Europe). Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective study. Data were obtained from the System for the Development of Research in Primary Care and from the Catalan Meteorological Service. The outcome was first emergency hospitalizations due to coronary heart disease, stroke, or heart failure. Exposures were: cold spells; cold spells and 3 or 7 subsequent days; and heatwaves. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the self-controlled case series method. We accounted for age, time trends, and air pollutants; results were shown by age groups, gender or cardiovascular event type. Results: There were 22,611 cardiovascular hospitalizations in winter and 17,017 in summer between 2006 and 2013. The overall incidence of cardiovascular hospitalizations significantly increased during cold spells (IRR = 1.120; CI 95%: 1.10-1.30) and the effect was even stronger in the 7 days subsequent to the cold spell (IRR = 1.29; CI 95%: 1.22-1. 36). Conversely, cardiovascular hospitalizations did not increase during heatwaves, neither in the overall nor in the stratified analysis. Conclusions: Cold spells but not heatwaves, increased the incidence of emergency cardiovascular hospitalizations in Catalonia. The effect of cold spells was greater when including the 7 subsequent days. Such knowledge might be useful to develop strategies to reduce the impact of extreme temperature episodes on human health.

Abstract: Genomic DNA is dynamically associated with protein factors and folded to form chromatin fibers. The 3-dimensional (3D) configuration of the chromatin will enable the distal genetic elements to come into close proximity, allowing transcriptional regulation. Noncoding RNA can mediate the 3D structure of chromatin. Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET) is a valuable and powerful technique in molecular biology which allows the study of unbiased, genome-wide de novo chromatin interactions with paired-end tags. Here, we describe the standard version of ChIA-PET and a Multiplex ChIA-PET version.

Title:  bufalin; human erythroid leukemic cells; Wilm's tumor 1 gene; methylation; DNA methyltransferase 3a; DNA methyltransferase 3b        
Abstract: To explore the effects of bufalin on inhibiting proliferation, up-regulating methylation of Wilm' tumor 1 gene (WT1) as well as its possible mechanisms in human erythroid leukemic (HEL) cells. The HEL cells were treated with bufalin at various concentrations to observe cellular morphology, proliferation assay and cell cycle. The mRNA and protein expression levels of WT1 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot and immunocytochemistry, DNA methylation of WT1 and protein expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) and DNMT3b were analyzed by methylation-specific PCR, and Western blot respectively. The bufalin was effective to inhibit proliferation of HEL cells in a dose-dependent manner, their suppression rates were from 23.4%+/- 2.1% to 87.2%+/- 5.4% with an half maximal inhibit concentration (IC50) of 0.046 mu mol/L. Typical apoptosis morphology was observed in bufalin-treated HEL cells. The proliferation index of cell cycle decreased from 76.4%+/- 1.9% to 49.7%+/- 1.3%. The expression levels of WT1 mRNA and its protein reduced gradually with increasing doses of bufalin, meanwhile, the methylation status of WT1 gene changed from unmethylated into partially or totally methylated. While, the expression levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b protein gradually increased by bufalin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Bufalin can not only significantly inhibit the proliferation of HEL cells and arrest cell cycle at G(0)/G(1) phase, but also induce cellular apoptosis and down-regulate the expression level of WT1. Our results provide the evidence of bufalin for anti-leukemia, its mechanism may involve in increasing WT1 methylation status which is related to the up-regulation of DNMT3a and DNMT3b proteins in erythroid leukemic HEL cells.

Title:  cirrhosis; mortality; muscle mass; sarcopenia; testosterone        
Abstract: Background and AimBoth sarcopenia and low serum testosterone have been associated with increased mortality in men with cirrhosis. It is not known how these variables interact. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 145 men referred for liver transplant evaluation between 2005 and 2012. Baseline demographics included hormone profile and model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Baseline computerized tomography was reformatted to calculate skeletal muscle area at L4 using validated, Tomovision software-based methodology. The primary outcome was time to death or liver transplantation. ResultsMedian testosterone was low at 6.2nmol/L (ref. 10-27.6nmol/L) as was muscle mass at 48.0cm(2)/m(2) (ref. >52.4cm(2)/m(2)). Muscle mass correlated with both serum testosterone (tau=0.132, P=0.019) and MELD score (tau=-0.155, P=0.007). In separate multivariable models, both sarcopenia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, P=0.04) and low testosterone (HR 1.08, P=0.01) were significantly associated with mortality independent of MELD score. When the variables MELD score, muscle area, and testosterone were entered into a single model, low testosterone but not sarcopenia remained significantly predictive of mortality (HR 1.07, P=0.02, and HR 1.04, P=0.09, respectively). ConclusionLow testosterone and sarcopenia are both associated with increased mortality in men with advanced liver disease and may identify patients at high risk of mortality that would be missed by the MELD score alone. Low testosterone appears to be a better predictor of mortality than sarcopenia and is a simpler test to improve the prognostic value of the MELD score. Interventional trials are required to determine whether low testosterone and sarcopenia are markers or mediators of mortality in this population.

Title:  Microphysiological modeling; reproductive signaling; repro-on-a-chip        
Abstract: Preclinical toxicity testing in animal models is a cornerstone of the drug development process, yet it is often unable to predict adverse effects and tolerability issues in human subjects. Species-specific responses to investigational drugs have led researchers to utilize human tissues and cells to better estimate human toxicity. Unfortunately, human cell-derived models are imperfect because toxicity is assessed in isolation, removed from the normal physiologic microenvironment. Microphysiological modeling often referred to as organ-on-a-chip' or human-on-a-chip' places human tissue into a microfluidic system that mimics the complexity of human invivo physiology, thereby allowing for toxicity testing on several cell types, tissues, and organs within a more biologically relevant environment. Here we describe important concepts when developing a repro-on-a-chip model. The development of female and male reproductive microfluidic systems is critical to sex-based invitro toxicity and drug testing. This review addresses the biological and physiological aspects of the male and female reproductive systems invivo and what should be considered when designing a microphysiological human-on-a-chip model. Additionally, interactions between the reproductive tract and other systems are explored, focusing on the impact of factors and hormones produced by the reproductive tract and disease pathophysiology.

Title:  Medical education; community-based research; HIV/AIDS; testing and counselling; stigma        
Abstract: People living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) are increasingly recognized as experts in HIV and their own health. We developed a simulated clinical encounter (SCE) in which medical students provided HIV pre-and post-test counselling and point-of-care HIV testing for PHAs as patient instructors (PHA-PIs) under clinical preceptor supervision. The study assessed the acceptability of this teaching tool with a focus on assessing impact on HIV-related stigma among medical students. University of Toronto pre-clerkship medical students participated in a series of SCEs facilitated by 16 PHA-PIs and 22 clinical preceptors. Pre-and post-SCE students completed the validated Health Care Provider HIV/AIDS Stigma Scale (HPASS). HPASS measures overall stigma, as well as three domains within HIV stigma: stereotyping, discrimination, and prejudice. Higher scores represented higher levels of stigma. An additional questionnaire measured comfort in providing HIV-related care. Mean scores and results of paired t-tests are presented. Post-SCE, students (n = 62) demonstrated decreased overall stigma (68.74 vs. 61.81, p < .001) as well as decreased stigma within each domain. Post-SCE, students (n = 67) reported increased comfort in providing HIVrelated care (10.24 vs. 18.06, p < .001). Involving PHA-PIs reduced HIV-related stigma among medical students and increased comfort in providing HIV-related care.

Title:  Geosynthetics; Geotextiles; Centrifuge; Reinforced soil; Creep        
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a centrifuge study performed to investigate the time-dependent behavior of geotextile-reinforced soil walls. To this effect, reduced-scale centrifuge models were built using nonwoven fabrics as reinforcement elements and Monterey no. 30 sand as backfill. Digital image analysis techniques were used to quantify the internal displacements within the reinforced zone, where sand markers had been placed along the reinforcement layers. A sigmoid function was found to provide adequate fit to raw displacement data, allowing estimation of the strain distribution along the reinforcement layers. This investigation includes an initial series of centrifuge models designated as ""Short-term"" tests, which were loaded to failure by continuously increasing the acceleration imparted to them. In addition, a series of models designated as ""Long-term"" tests were conducted by subjecting them to constant accelerations corresponding to 25%, 40%, 60% and 80% of the g-level at failure obtained from the ""Short-term"" tests. The results revealed that walls subjected to constant acceleration showed a time dependent behavior that adversely affected their stability. Considerable time-dependent deformations were observed to occur during the ""Long-term"" tests. That is, time-dependent deformations in the reinforcements, quantified using geosynthetic samples tested in isolation, were found to also develop under confinement in the centrifuge models. In particular, creep failure was observed in the ""Long-term"" models subjected to comparatively high levels of constant acceleration. The time-dependent deformations from confined geotextiles tested in the centrifuge testing program were compared against the results from unconfined geotextiles tested in a conventional creep testing program. The time to failure defined using data from centrifuge tests was found to be consistent with that obtained from conventional creep tests. The soil used in the centrifuge models in this study, frequently considered as having negligible creep, was ultimately found not to prevent the development of time-dependent deformations.

Title:  homelessness; permanent supportive housing; health and mental health outcomes; peer-support workers        
Abstract: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) is an evidence-based health intervention for persons experiencing homelessness, but the impact of individual mechanisms within this intervention on health requires further research. This study examines the longitudinal impact of the mechanism of supportive housing within a peer-delivered PSH model on overall health and mental health (as measured by psychological distress and self-report of bothersome symptoms) outcomes in an ethnically diverse population. The 237 participants in the study included persons who were homeless or at risk of homelessness and who also had been diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Sixty-one percent of all participants received supportive housing. All 3 outcomes were significantly associated with quality of life indicators, recovery, and social connectedness. In addition, overall health was significantly associated with employment, age, and psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with gender, type of housing, and history of violence or trauma. Experiencing bothersome symptoms was associated with drug use, history of violence or trauma, and psychological distress. Longitudinal models of these 3 outcomes showed that supportive housing was significantly associated with good to excellent health 6 months after baseline (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% confidence interval [1.12, 8.66]). The models also demonstrated that the supportive housing and comparison groups experienced decreased psychological distress after baseline. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of supportive housing within the context of PSH, particularly for the overall health of participants, and the positive overall impact of PSH on mental health in a diverse population.

Title:  assessment; computational thinking; computer programming; video        
Abstract: In this paper we present CodeCraft, an educational video game we are developing to teach the fundamentals of computer programming. Similar to other educational tools such as Scratch, Alice, Project Spark, and Code Spells; CodeCraft provides users with an intuitive graphical interface for writing programs. However, CodeCraft is a video game that uses a problem-based learning approach in which players learn programming concepts by solving individual puzzles in an immersive 3D environment. Moreover, CodeCraft is intended to be an autonomous learning game that can be played without teacher support, thereby potentially reaching students in all economic, ethnic, and gender groups. Using an iterative development process and evidence-centered design, this work proposes to further develop CodeCraft and evaluate how it can improve performance in acquiring programming skills.

Abstract: Mode division multiplexing (MDM) is a promising technology for increasing the aggregate bandwidth of multimode fiber (MMF) in conjunction with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in face of the impending capacity crunch in optical fiber networks. This paper investigates the effect of radial and azimuthal mode spacings in a 25-channel MDM-WDM system in MMF using a spatial light modulator-controlled VCSEL array for excitation of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes. A data rate of 25Gbps is achieved at a central wavelength of 1550.12 nm. The effects of different azimuthal and radial mode spacings of LG modes are analyzed in terms of the channel impulse response, eye diagram and bit-error rate.

Abstract: I have written previously about the allure and hazards of that ""promise of love"" that can be a siren's call luring us into terrible dangers ( Charles, 1999). The intense intimacy of the analytic environment is also regressive, pulling on primitive memories that have a heightened, sensory quality, often having to do with early experiences of frustrated desire. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy invites the patient to transfer feelings from childhood and later life onto the analyst. Coming into contact with primitive and forbidden longings helps the individual make sense of forces that drive her thinking and action. For such powerful forces to be unleashed, the consulting room must be a place of safety in which fantasies can be enacted without fear of actualizing them. The analyst, too, feels these regressive desires but must be able to stand her ground and allow the transference to unfold such that the patient can encounter her longings and desire and work her way through them rather than expecting them to be filled in the consulting room. Two cases are described in which such boundaries had been broken and the patients sought assistance in dealing with the sequelae. These cases remind us that our own desires to be the perfect parent or analyst can be obstructive and destructive if we lose our analytic mind and move into the realm of transgressive enactment rather than preserving the space for working through.

Title:  Ets1; target genes; ChIP-seq; RNA-seq; promoter; enhancer; autoimmunity        
Abstract: Background: The transcription factor Ets1 is highly expressed in B lymphocytes. Loss of Ets1 leads to premature B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), secretion of autoantibodies, and development of autoimmune disease. Despite the importance of Ets1 in B cell biology, few Ets1 target genes are known in these cells. Results: To obtain a more complete picture of the function of Ets1 in regulating B cell differentiation, we performed Ets1 ChIP-seq in primary mouse B cells to identify >10,000-binding sites, many of which were localized near genes that play important roles in B cell activation and differentiation. Although Ets1 bound to many sites in the genome, it was required for regulation of less than 5% of them as evidenced by gene expression changes in B cells lacking Ets1. The cohort of genes whose expression was altered included numerous genes that have been associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility. We focused our attention on four such Ets1 target genes Ptpn22, Stat4, Egr1, and Prdm1 to assess how they might contribute to Ets1 function in limiting ASC formation. We found that dysregulation of these particular targets cannot explain altered ASC differentiation in the absence of Ets1. Conclusion: We have identified genome-wide binding targets for Ets1 in B cells and determined that a relatively small number of these putative target genes require Ets1 for their normal expression. Interestingly, a cohort of genes associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility is among those that are regulated by Ets1. Identification of the target genes of Ets1 in B cells will help provide a clearer picture of how Ets1 regulates B cell responses and how its loss promotes autoantibody secretion.

Title:  Discarbazolyl tetraphenylethylene; Aggregation-induced emission effect; Piezofluorochromism; Organic light emitting diode(OLED)        
Abstract: The development of organic fluorescent materials was of great interest for both fundamental research and practical applications. Piezofluorochromic or piezochromic fluorescent material was a ""smart"" material of which fluorescent properties were changed in response to external pressure stimuli. However, piezofluorochromic materials depended on the change of physical molecular packing modes were remaining extremely rare. In this work, a new discarbazolyl tetraphenylethylene compound was synthesized. The chemical structures of the derivative was determined by H-1 NMR, MS and elemental analyses, and its properties were investigated by PL, TGA, DSC and CV methods. The results show that the compound possess piezofluorochromic properties as well as aggregation-induced emission enhancement effect. The PL intensity and quantum yield in DMF/H2O with high water fraction were about 171, 100 times higher than those in pure DMF, respectively. The piezofluorochromic nature was generated through phase transformation from crystalline state (450 nm) to amorphous state(480 nm) under the external stimuli. The organic light emitting diode(OLED) device fabricated with the compound as non-doped emitters exhibited good performances with a maximum brightness of 2438 cd/m(2), a maximum current efficiency of 2.87 cd/A, and a maximum power efficiency of 1.81 lm/W. It is indicated that the compound is a multi-functional luminophor.

Title:  Hydrogels; Ag nanoparticles; Nanocomposites; Swelling; Antibacterial activities        
Abstract: A pH-responsive copolymer hydrogel was synthesized based on methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) as monomers, and was adopted as a nanoreactor for assembling Ag nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to fully characterize the formation of silver nanoparticles in P(MMA-co-MAA) hydrogels. The experimental results showed that the P(MMA-co-MAA) hydrogels assume a three-networks architecture in morphologies, and that nearly spherical Ag nanoparticles are formed in these hydrogel networks; the size of these Ag nanoparticles varies with the system composition. The swelling kinetics investigations demonstrated that the equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR) of the P(MMA-co-MAA)/Ag hydrogels depended on the content of the MAA and pH of the buffer solutions, and the ESR values were reduced with increasing MAA contents. The antibacterial properties against both S. aureus and B. subtilis bacteria demonstrated that the P(MMA-co-MAA)/silver nanocomposite hydrogels had higher antimicrobial efficacy than the pure P(MMA-co-MAA) counterparts. Therefore, the nanocomposite hydrogels turned out to be a potentially smart material in the range of applications of antibacterial activity.

Abstract: Pathomorphological study of trephinobiopsy specimens from 129 patients with lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases was carried out over the course of chemotherapy. Combinations of initial and manifest myelofibrosis (loose network of reticulin fibers and extensive network of reticulin and collagen fibers, respectively) predominated at the debut of chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Manifest myelofibrosis was detected in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia without hematological response (failure of normalization of hematological values) and in patients with progressing and relapsing multiple myeloma. Combinations of foci of initial and manifest myelofibrosis were most incident in patients with progressing and relapsing chronic lymphoid leukemia. The incidence of myelofibrosis was higher in patients with multiple myeloma and chronic lymphoid leukemia progression and relapses and in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia without hematological response than at the disease debut and in case of response to chemotherapy. The response to chemotherapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphoid leukemia was associated with a decrease in the incidence of myelofibrosis. In patients with multiple myeloma responding to chemotherapy, the incidence of myelofibrosis did not change in comparison with the disease debut.

Title:  HIV; AIDS; social movements; activism; transnationalism; apartheid; post-apartheid; South Africa        
Abstract: As the South African HIV/AIDS epidemic enters its fourth decade, universal access to treatment has begun to extend the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS. While the South Africa's ruling party - the African National Congress - has seized on improved health to bolster their political profile, the key agitators in producing this outcome were South African HIV/AIDS activists. Narrative accounts of the extended initiative have focused on the organisations that led the campaign for treatment access, such as the Treatment Access Campaign. Reflecting present trends in social movement theory, the emphasis in these accounts has been on transnational and/or horizontal' ties in alliance building. This approach obscures continuities with early South African HIV/AIDS activism during the late apartheid era. The concept of verticality is proposed as a means of highlighting the role of interpersonal relationships in the development of institutions and transmission of knowledge practices that link the waves of South African HIV/AIDS activism.

Title:  Network security; Scanning worms; Worm model; Stochastic worm model; Continuous-time Markov chain        
Abstract: Internet worm infection continues to be one of top security threats and has been widely used by botnets to recruit newbots. In order to defend against future worms, it is important to understand how worms propagate and how different scanning strategies affect worm propagation dynamics. In our study, we present a (stochastic) continuous-time Markov chain model for characterizing the propagation of Internet worms. The model is developed for uniform scanning worms, and further for local preference scanning worms and flash worms. Specifically, for uniform and local preference scanning worms, we are able to (1) provide a precise condition that determines whether the worm spread would eventually stop and (2) obtain the distribution of the total number of infected hosts. By using the same modeling approach, we reveal the underlying similarity and relationship between uniform scanning and local preference scanning worms. Finally, we validate the model by simulating the propagation of worms.

Title:  Heat transfer; Legionella; Plate heat exchanger; Modeling; Water thermal treatment        
Abstract: The work refers to an innovative system inspired by nature that mimics the thermoregulation system that exists in animals. This method, which is called Anti Bacteria Heat Exchanger (ABHE), is proposed to achieve continuous thermal disinfection of bacteria in hot water systems with high energy efficiency. In particular, this study aims to demonstrate the opportunity to gain energy by means of recovering heat over a plate heat exchanger. Firstly, the thermodynamics of the ABHE is clarified to define the ABHE specification. Secondly, a first prototype of an ABHE is built with a specific configuration based on simplicity regarding design and construction. Thirdly, an experimental test is carried out. Finally, a computer model is built to simulate the ABHE system and the experimental data is used to validate the model. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the ABHE system is strongly dependent on the flow rate, while the supplied temperature has less effect. Experimental and simulation data show a large potential for saving energy of this thermal disinfection method by recovering heat. To exemplify, when supplying water at a flow rate of 5 kg/min and at a temperature of 50 degrees C, the heat recovery is about 1.5 kW while the required pumping power is 1 W. This means that the pressure drop is very small compared to the energy recovered and consequently high saving in total cost is promising. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  State estimation; Power system; Artificial intelligence; Particle swarm optimization; Genetic algorithm        
Abstract: The electrical network measurements are usually sent to the control centers using specific communication protocols. However, these measurements contain uncertainties due to the meters and communication errors (noise), incomplete metering or unavailability of some of these measurements. The aim of state estimation is to estimate the state variables of the power system by minimizing all measurement errors available at the control center. In the past, many traditional algorithms, based on gradient approach, have been used for this purpose. This paper discusses the application of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (PSO), to solve the state estimation problem within a power system. Two objective functions are formulated: the weighted least square (WLS) and weighted least absolute value (WLAV). The effectiveness of PSO over another AI optimization algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), is shown by comparing both two solutions to the true state variable values obtained using Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm.

Title:  Parallel power flow; Map-Reduce framework; Performance model; Distributed computing; Hadoop cluster        
Abstract: Application of smart grid produces massive data. Unfortunately, the traditional analysis of power systems can not process such a huge volume of data in an efficient manner. Distributed computing like Map-Reduce framework in cloud environment can provide a promising solution to this problem by processing the data in parallel on a large amount of computing nodes. In this paper, we parallelize power flow calculation based on Map-Reduce programming framework and evaluate the efficiency. T he classic NewtonRaphson method commonly used in power flow calculation is totally parallelized. To solve sparse linear equations in Map-Reduce framework, the factorization tree is carefully partitioned and in turn, all the variables in subtrees which are independent with each other can be calculated in parallel. Moreover, to map the proposed algorithm into MapReduce jobs, we also define the appropriate formats for the input, intermediate and output data. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Title:  fMRI; Borderline Personality Disorder; Emotion regulation; Amygdala; Prefrontal cortex        
Abstract: The present neuroimaging study investigated two aspects of difficulties with emotion associated with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): affective lability and difficulty regulating emotion. While these two characteristics have been previously linked to BPD symptomology, it remains unknown whether individual differences in affective lability and emotion regulation difficulties are subserved by distinct neural substrates within a BPD sample. To address this issue, sixty women diagnosed with BPD were scanned while completing a task that assessed baseline emotional reactivity as well as top-down emotion regulation. More affective instability, as measured by the Affective Lability Scale (ALS), positively correlated with greater amygdala responses on trials assessing emotional reactivity. Greater difficulties with regulating emotion, as measured by the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), was negatively correlated with left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) recruitment on trials assessing regulatory ability. These findings suggest that, within a sample of individuals with BPD, greater bottom-up amygdala activity is associated with heightened affective lability. By contrast, difficulties with emotion regulation are related to reduced IFG recruitment during emotion regulation. These results point to distinct neural mechanisms for different aspects of BPD symptomology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  variable flux machines; low coercive field magnet; spoke type permanent magnet motor; finite element analysis        
Abstract: The paper presents a design procedure for tangentially magnetized variable flux machines that aims to reduce the machine inverter rating. The proposed design can achieve high torque density at low speeds, and high efficiency at an extended speed range, as armature d-axis current pulses are applied at high speeds to reduce the magnet flux, thus avoiding the flux weakening current in conventional permanent magnet synchronous (PMSMs) machines. In order to regain the full torque capability when the motor slows down, a magnetizing current pulse has to be applied. The amplitude of the magnetizing current is usually larger than the machine rated current. Therefore, the machine might need an oversized inverter in order to be able to re-magnetize the magnets. The impact of different machine design parameters on the magnetization current requirement is investigated in order to reduce the inverter cost.

Abstract: Objective: In the present study, we aimed to detect the levels of IL-17 in the serum, synovial fluid, and synovial membrane of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and investigate their association with the severity of articular cartilage damage and synovitis. Methods: According to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis, 46 cases diagnosed with knee OA (KOA group) were selected from patients that underwent arthroscopic surgery at our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014. Additional 46 cases with other knee joint diseases (non-KOA group) were included as controls. The IL-17 levels in synovial fluid and serum were assayed by ELISA, and those in the synovial membrane were assayed by immunohistochemistry. The severity of knee articular cartilage damage and synovitis-related pathological changes was evaluated by arthroscopy using the Outerbridge and Ayral scores, respectively. Results: IL-17 levels in the synovial fluid and synovial membranes of the KOA group were significantly higher than in the non-KOA group (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-17 in the synovial fluid and synovial membranes were positively correlated with the serum level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), the Outerbridge score, and the Ayral score in the KOA group. Conclusion: IL-17 levels in the synovial fluid and synovial membrane are increased in KOA patients and are positively correlated with KOA severity.

Title:  Bluff-body aerodynamics; Nonlinearity; Navier-Stokes equations; Volterra theory        
Abstract: A nonlinear analysis framework for bluff-body aerodynamics based on Volterra theory is introduced to capture the linear and nonlinear aerodynamic effects. The Volterra kernels based on the impulse function concept are identified by way of the simulation of Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The computational schemes used here are validated through theoretical consideration, i.e., Blasius solution for the steady-state and Theodorsen solution for the system dynamic-state simulation. The source of nonlinearities in the aerodynamics of bluff bodies is systematically investigated. The simulation of bluff-body aerodynamics based on the Volterra reduced-order modeling scheme is obtained by the convolution of the identified kernels with the external inputs, e.g., turbulent inflow or body motion for aerodynamic or aeroelastic response, respectively. It is demonstrated that the Volterra theory-based nonlinear analysis framework for bluff-body aerodynamics combined with the identification of kernels using CFD promises to capture the salient features of bluff-body aerodynamics and offers an accurate reduced-order approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations with reduced level of computational effort.

Title:  Spinal fusion; Bone graft; Facetectomy; Mesenchymal stem cell; Osteogenesis        
Abstract: The promotion of spinal fusion using bone autografts is largely mediated by the osteoinductive potential of progenitors/mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that reside in the marrow spaces of cancellous bone. Iliac crest is the common autograft donor site, but its use presents an increased risk for donor site pain, morbidity and infection. Degenerative bone samples harvested during facetectomy might provide an alternative viable source of osteoinductive autografts. In this study, we conducted an intra-individual comparison of the osteogenic potential of isolated low passage MSC from both sources. Iliac crest and degenerative facet joints were harvested from eight consecutive patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interspinal fusion due to lumbar spinal stenosis. MSC were isolated by collagenase digestion, selected by plastic adherence and minimally expanded for downstream assays. Clonogenic and osteogenic potential was evaluated by colony formation assays in control and osteogenic culture medium. Osteogenic properties, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) induction, matrix mineralization and type I collagen mRNA and protein expression were characterized using quantitative histochemical staining and reverse transcription PCR. Spontaneous adipogenesis was analysed by adipocyte enumeration and gene expression analysis of adipogenic markers. Average colony-forming efficiency in osteogenic medium was equal between iliac crest (38 +/- 12%) and facet joint (36 +/- 11%). Osteogenic potential at the clonal level was 55 +/- 26 and 68 +/- 17% for iliac crest and facet joint MSC, respectively. Clonogenic and osteogenic potential were significantly negatively associated with donor age. Osteogenic differentiation led to significant induction of ALP activity in iliac crest (sixfold) and facet joint (eightfold) MSC. Matrix mineralization quantified by Alizarin red staining was increased by osteogenic differentiation, yet similar between both MSC sources. Protein expression of type I collagen was enhanced during osteogenesis and significantly greater in iliac crest MSC. Correspondingly, COL1A2 mRNA expression was higher in osteogenically differentiated MSC from iliac crest. Adipocyte numbers showed significant differences between iliac crest (63 +/- 60) and facet joint (18 +/- 15) MSC under osteogenic conditions. Negative (GREM1) and positive (FABP4) adipogenic markers were not differentially expressed between sources. MSC from iliac crest and degenerative facet joints largely display similar clonogenic and osteogenic properties in vitro. Differences at the molecular level are not likely to impair the osteoinductive capacity of facet joint MSC. Bone autografts from facetectomy would be viable alternatives as bone autografts for intervertebral spinal fusion in lumbar spinal stenosis.

Title:  False memories; Self-efficacy; Working memory        
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between self-efficacy and false memories using the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, whereby people falsely remember words not presented in lists. In two studies participants were presented with DRM lists and asked to recall and recognize presented items. In the first study, we found a significant relationship between memory self-efficacy (MSE) and susceptibility to associative memory illusions, both in recall and recognition. They also received the Memory Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (MSEQ), the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ) and the backward digit span (BDS) test. In the second study, MSE was manipulated in order to assess whether changes influenced the sensitivity parameter in DRM tasks. Results showed that the manipulation was effective in decreasing self-efficacy, which in turn affected the probability of reporting critical lures as well as sensitivity. Possible explanations for the effect are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

Title:  cell mechanics; cell water dynamics; cytoskeleton mechanics        
Abstract: Under the microscope, eukaryotic animal cells can adopt a variety of different shapes and sizes. These cells also move and deform, and the physical mechanisms driving these movements and shape changes are important in fundamental cell biology, tissue mechanics, as well as disease biology. This article reviews some of the basic mechanical concepts in cells, emphasizing continuum mechanics description of cytoskeletal networks and hydrodynamic flows across the cell membrane. We discuss how cells can generate movement and shape changes by controlling mass fluxes at the cell boundary. These mass fluxes can come from polymerization/depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton, as well as osmotic and hydraulic pressure-driven flow of water across the cell membrane. By combining hydraulic pressure control with force balance conditions at the cell surface, we discuss a quantitative mechanism of cell shape and volume control. The broad consequences of this model on cell mechanosensation and tissue mechanics are outlined.

Title:  Anaphylaxis; mast cell; bradykinin; mouse models; tryptase; contact system        
Abstract: Background: Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially lethal, multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell-derived mediators into the circulation. Objectives and Methods: We report here that a plasma protease cascade, the factor XII-driven contact system, critically contributes to the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis in both murine models and human subjects. Results: Deficiency in or pharmacologic inhibition of factor XII, plasma kallikrein, high-molecular-weight kininogen, or the bradykinin B2 receptor, but not the B1 receptor, largely attenuated allergen/IgE-mediated mast cell hyperresponsiveness in mice. Reconstitutions of factor XII null mice with human factor XII restored susceptibility for allergen/IgE-mediated hypotension. Activated mast cells systemically released heparin, which provided a negatively charged surface for factor XII autoactivation. Activated factor XII generates plasma kallikrein, which proteolyzes kininogen, leading to the liberation of bradykinin. We evaluated the contact system in patients with anaphylaxis. In all 10 plasma samples immunoblotting revealed activation of factor XII, plasma kallikrein, and kininogen during the acute phase of anaphylaxis but not at basal conditions or in healthy control subjects. The severity of anaphylaxis was associated with mast cell degranulation, increased plasma heparin levels, the intensity of contact system activation, and bradykinin formation. Conclusions: In summary, the data collectively show a role of the contact system in patients with anaphylaxis and support the hypothesis that targeting bradykinin generation and signaling provides a novel and alternative treatment strategy for anaphylactic attacks.

Abstract: The aim of this work was to study the influence of the binary and ternary combinations of bovine plasma proteins (BPP), inulin (I) and -carrageenan (C) in the overall quality of fat-reduced sausages. The influence of these components over different properties (chemical composition, weight loss after cooking, emulsion stability, texture profile and sensory analysis of fat-reduced sausages) was studied and compared against two samples, one without fat reduction and another a fat-reduced sample without addition of texturing agents. In this sense, a full factorial experimental design of two levels with central point was used. The samples containing BPP+I and BPP+C showed a synergy in which the binary combinations presented higher values of moisture and protein content than the samples containing the individual components. The reduction of fat content increases the values of hardness and decreases the values of springiness. Samples with 5% BPP (w/w) and binary combinations of BPP+C and BPP+I had the best stability values (low total fluid loss), demonstrating a significant synergistic effect by combining BPP+C. Similar results were obtained from the study of weight loss after cooking. However, both studies showed a destabilization of the sample BPP+I+C as emulsion stability decreased and weight loss increased after cooking compared to binary combinations (P0.05). The less acceptable sample for flavor and texture was the one containing only BPP. However, when BPP combined with I or C, a major acceptability was obtained, demonstrating the synergistic effect of these binary combinations. Therefore, our studies revealed that the binary combinations of BPP with I or C are good alternatives for the development of fat-reduced sausage.

Title:  cytokine; inflammation; genetics; NSAID; self-medication; NHANES III        
Abstract: Background: Genetic influences on self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs merit investigation. For example, patients frequently use OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat inflammation, but the inflammatory response is also affected by endogenous cytokines whose production varies across polymorphisms of their encoding genes. In the case of interleukin 10 (IL-10), literature suggests that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the cytokine's gene (-1082 A >G [rs1800896]) influences production with higher levels associated with G variant alleles. Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of researching the role of genetics in self-medication by using existing national survey data to evaluate a possible association between OTC NSAID use and genotype at the -1082 SNP of the IL-10 gene. Methods: Statistical analyses were performed using data from 6,309 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Results: OTC NSAID use (aspirin or ibuprofen) in the previous month was significantly more common among persons with AG or GG genotypes at the -1082 SNP. Odds of use consistently increased relative to the number of G alleles. This trend remained statistically significant (odds ratio = 1.14 per additional G allele, p = .02, 95% confidence interval [1.02, 1.27]) after adjustment for confounding. Conclusions: Analysis of population-based genetic data suggests an association between a common self-medication behavior and a specific genetic polymorphism. These findings broadly demonstrate that NHANES data provide opportunities to investigate such associations and specifically imply that potential interrelationships among OTC NSAID use, IL-10 genotype, and IL-10 cytokine levels deserve further study.

Title:  Atrial fibrillation; Direct oral anticoagulant; Left atrial appendage thrombus; Transesophageal echocardiography; Warfarin        
Abstract: Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia, associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including thromboembolic events. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi in Japanese non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients undergoing preprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during anticoagulation therapy, and to compare the efficacy of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). Methods and Results: This retrospective study reviewed records of 559 consecutive NVAF patients (445 men; age, 62 +/- 11 years) undergoing preprocedural TEE following at least 3 weeks of anticoagulation therapy. Of these, 275 patients had non-paroxysmal AF (49%). LAA thrombus was observed in 15 patients (2.7%). The prevalence of LAA thrombi was similar between the DOAC group (2.6%) and the warfarin group (2.8%, P=0.86). No patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score=0, or paroxysmal AF without prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, had LAA thrombi. On univariate analysis, non-paroxysmal AF, structural heart disease, antiplatelet therapy, larger left atrium, higher brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), reduced LAA flow, and higher CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score were all associated with LAA thrombi. On multivariate analysis, BNP >= 173pg/mL remained the only independent predictor of LAA thrombi. Conclusions: LAA thrombi were found in 2.7% of Japanese NVAF patients scheduled for procedures despite ongoing oral anticoagulation therapy. Incidence of thrombi was similar for patients on DOAC and on warfarin.

Title:  enzymology; kinetics; liver; lung; brain; ketone bodies; lyase activity; endoplasmic reticulum-cytosolic HMG-CoA lyase; mitochondrial HMG-CoA lyase        
Abstract: A novel lyase activity enzyme is characterized for the first time: HMG-CoA lyase-like1 (er-cHL), which is a close homolog of mitochondrial HMG-CoA lyase (mHL). Initial data show that there are nine mature transcripts for the novel gene HMGCLL1, although none of them has all its exons. The most abundant transcript is called ""variant b,"" and it lacks exons 2 and 3. Moreover, a three-dimensional model of the novel enzyme is proposed. Colocalization studies show a dual location of the er-cHL in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol, but not in mitochondria or peroxisomes. Furthermore, the dissociation experiment suggests that it is a nonendoplasmic reticulum integral membrane protein. The kinetic parameters of er-cHL indicate that it has a lower V-max and a higher substrate affinity than mHL. Protein expression and lyase activity were found in several tissues, and were particularly strong in lung and kidney. The occurrence of er-cHL in brain is surprising, as mHL has not been found there. Although mHL activity is clearly associated with energy metabolism, the results suggest that er-cHL is more closely related to another metabolic function, mostly at the pulmonary and brain level.-Arnedo, M., S.

Title:  Bronze age; classical and Hellenistic periods; flood risks; modern and future times; rainwater harvesting; Roman and post-Roman times        
Abstract: The low water availability in several regions of southeastern Hellas and particularly in several islands, such as Crete, has resulted in the construction of various types of water reservoir for collection and storage of rainwater, since their very early habitation. Since then, technologies for the construction and use of several types of cisterns have been developed. In Crete during the Minoan era, water cisterns were very well practiced as a basic means for water supply in several settlements. The Minoan water cistern technologies were further developed, mainly by enlargement of the scale of water systems, at subsequent stages of the Hellenic civilizations. Furthermore, more advanced water cistern technologies were invented, with a peak during the Hellenistic period which followed Alexander the Great, during which time they spread over a geographical area from Hellas to the west and to the east. The Romans inherited the cistern technologies and further developed them mainly by changing their application scale from small to large. Characteristic paradigms of Cretan cisterns are considered which justify the significance of that technology for water supply in areas with low water availability during the whole Cretan history. Herein, nowadays climatic conditions and water resources management in Crete are presented and discussed.

Title:  Medicaid; CHIP; Quality        
Abstract: Objective: The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was re-authorized in 2009, ushering in an unprecedented focus on children's health care quality one of which includes identifying a core set of performance measures for voluntary reporting by states' Medicaid/CHIP programs. However, there is a wide variation in the quantity and quality of measures states chose to report to the Center's for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The objective of this study is to assess reporting barriers and to identify potential opportunities for improvement. Methods: From 2013 to 2014 a questionnaire developed in coordination with CMS and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was sent to state Medicaid and CHIP officials to assess barriers to child health quality reporting for Federal Fiscal Year 2012. States were categorized as high, medium, or low reporting for comparative analysis. Results: Twenty-five of the 50 states and the District of Columbia agreed to participate in the study and completed the questionnaire. States placed a high priority on children's health care quality reporting (4.2 of 5 point Likert Scale, SD 0.99) and 96% plan to use measurement results to further improve their quality initiatives. However, low reporting states believed they had inadequate staffing and that data collection and extraction was too time-consuming than high reporting states. Conclusion: Based on state responses, possible solutions to improve reporting includes funding and staff support, refining the technical assistance provided, and creating venues for state-to-state interaction. Realistic and tangible improvements are within reach and opportunities for CMS and states to collaborate to improve child health care quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Itraconazole; Laser Treatment; Nd-YAG Laser; Onychomycosis        
Abstract: Background: Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail plate and subungual area. In this study, we examined the efficacy of laser treatment using self-controlled study programs involving a long-pulsed Nd:YAG 1064-nm laser combined with oral medication. Methods: Self-controlled strategies were followed in this study. The patients received treatment with oral itraconazole in conjunction with long-pulsed Nd: YAG 1064-nm laser treatment at the nails of the unilateral limb once a week for a total of four times. A total of 84 affected nails were divided into Group A (mild to moderate) and Group B (severe) according to disease severity. Affected nails with the same Scoring Clinical Index for Onychomycosis scores were selected to compare the therapeutic effects of the pure medication treatment group and the combination treatment group with a 24-week follow-up period. Results: In Group A, at the 8th, 16th, and 24th weeks of follow-up, the efficacies in the pure medication treatment group were 81.0%, 81.0%, and 90.5%, respectively, while those in the combination treatment group were 100%, 95.2%, and 90.5%, respectively. The differences between groups were not significant (8th week: chi(2) = 4.421, P >0.05; 16th week: chi(2) = 2.043, P >0.05; 24th week: chi(2) = 0.00, P >0.05). In Group B, at the 8th, 16th, and 24th weeks of follow-up, the efficacies in the pure medication treatment group were 61.9%, 66.7%, and 52.4%, respectively, while those in the combination treatment group were 95.2%, 90.5%, and 100%, respectively. The differences between groups at the 8th and 24th weeks of follow-up were statistically significant (8th week: chi(2) = 6.929, P < 0.05; 24th week: chi(2) = 13.125, P < 0.05). Conclusions: For patients with mild or moderate onychomycosis, we recommended a pure medication treatment or combination treatment with medication and laser. For those patients with severe onychomycosis, we recommended a combination of medication and laser therapy.

Title:  carbonyl iron; MOCVD; electromagnetic; microwave absorption        
Abstract: Nowadays, more and more researchers pay attention to the microwave absorbing materials with the increase of electromagnetic pollution and the development of stealth technology for military platforms. Traditional microwave absorbers, such as ferrite, metal powder, conductive magnetic fibers, magnetic flake powder, and nanoparticles and so on, are facing some common problems such as large specific gravity, narrow absorption bandwidth, large match thickness and poor absorption performance. Composites with core-shell structures are becoming promising microwave absorbing material because such structure can exhibit magnetic and dielectric characteristics through the proper selection of core and shell materials. Thus, Fe(CO)(5) deposition on the SrFe12O19 surface has been considered for the fabrication of a new composite that possesses the advantages of these two materials. This new composite might also obtain remarkable microwave absorption through thin layer absorbers in the entire 2 similar to 18 GHz frequency range. The Fe-SrFe12O19 composites with core-shell structures were prepared by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using the SrFe12O19 and iron pentacarbonyl [Fe(CO)(5)] as the precursors. XRD, SEM, EDS and a vector network analyzer were used to characterize the structure and electromagnetic properties of the samples. The structure and morphology analyses show that the composites have complete core-shell structures with SrFe12O19 as core and Fe layers as shell. Fe nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on the surface of SrFe12O19 with thickness of about 0.5 mu m at the reaction temperature of 180 degrees C with N-2 flow rate of 30 mL/min for 30 mm. Simulation studies show that SrFe12O19 electromagnetic properties changed significantly and the absorbing properties got evidently improvement after Fe deposited on its surface. The samples prepared with deposition time of 30 min have the best absorbing properties. A reflection loss (RL) value exceeding -10 dB in the range of 6.8 similar to 18.0 GHz frequency was obtained by selecting an appropriate thickness of the absorber layer from 1.5 to 3.0 mm. Moreover, a minimum RL of -21.2 dB at was obtained for a 2.0 mm thick layer. Fe-deposited SrFe12O19 by MOCVD can significantly improve the electromagnetic properties of SrFe12O19 and Fe-SrFe12O19 composites could be used as an effective microwave absorption material.

Abstract: Lead (Pb) in public drinking water supplies has garnered much attention since the outset of the Flint water crisis. Pb is a known hazard in multiple environmental matrices, exposure from which results in long-term deleterious health effects in humans. This discussion paper aims to provide a succinct account of environmental Pb exposures with a focus on water Pb levels (WLLs) in the United States. It is understood that there is a strong correlation between WLLs and blood Pb levels (BLLs), and the associated health effects. However, within the Flint water crisis, more than water chemistry and Pb exposure occurred. A cascade of regulatory and bureaucratic failures culminated in the Flint water crisis. This paper will discuss pertinent regulations and responses including their limitations after an overview of the public health effects from Pb exposure as well as discussion on our limitations on monitoring and mitigating Pb in tap water. As the Flint water crisis also included increased Legionnares' disease, caused by Legionella pneumophila, this paper will discuss factors influencing L. pneumophila growth. This will highlight the systemic nature of changes to water chemistry and public health impacts. As we critically analyze these important aspects of water research, we offer discussions to stimulate future water quality research from a new and systemic perspective to inform and guide public health decision-making.

Title:  Convergence rate; delay units; fractional repetitive control (RC); pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) inverters; transient performance        
Abstract: In this paper, a parallel structure fractional repetitive control (RC) scheme is proposed to improve the performance of pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) inverters in fractional cases where the sampling rate of the digital control system is not an integral multiple of the fundamental frequency. By introducing a correction factor, the new control scheme increases the control gains for all harmonics and locates poles accurately at targeted harmonic frequencies. As a result, the proposed control scheme achieves better tracking and rejection performance than conventional RC. Moreover, the parallel structure fractional repetitive controller requires less data memory. Dynamic response is also improved. The stability and convergence of this method are proved. Experimental results on a single-phase PWM inverter illustrate the advantages of this control scheme.

Title:  Cancer; HIV; Aids; Epidemiology; HAART; Malignancy        
Abstract: Background: The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of non-AIDS defining malignancies (NADMs) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in British Columbia, focusing on clinical correlates, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, and survival, in order to elucidate mechanisms for NADM development. Methods: A retrospective population based analysis was carried out for individuals with HIV/AIDS that began their treatment between 1996 and 2008. Results: There were 145 (2.95%) NADMs and 123 (2.50%) AIDS defining malignancies (ADMs) identified in 4918 PLWHA in the study population. NADMs were represented by a range of cancer types including, most commonly, lung cancer, followed by anal, breast, head/neck, prostate, liver, rectal, and renal cancers. PLWHA had a SIR of 2.05 (CI: 1.73, 2.41) for the development of NADMs compared to individuals without an HIV/AIDS diagnosis in the general population. Independent factors significantly associated with a NADM were: male gender, older age, lower CD4 cell counts, previous NADM, absence of HAART (non-HAART versus HAART) and treatment during the early-HAART era (before 2000 versus after 2000). Conclusions: NADMs represent an important source of morbidity for PLWHA. Use of HAART with its associated improvement in immune-restoration, and tailored targeted cancer screening interventions, may be beneficial and improve outcomes in this unique patient population.

Title:  Sand; Behaviour; Reinforcement; Geotextile; Cohesion; Friction angle        
Abstract: During the last earthquake that occurred in Chlef (El Asnam 1980, Algeria), a significant decrease in the shear strength has caused major damages to several civil and hydraulic structures (earth dams, embankments, bridges, slopes and buildings), especially for the saturated sandy soil of the areas near Chlef valley. This paper presents a laboratory study of drained compression triaxial tests conducted on sandy soil reinforced with horizontal layers of geotextile, in order to study the influence of geotextile layer characteristics both on shear stress-strain and on volumetric change-strain. Tests were carried out on medium and dense sand. The experimental programme includes some drained compression tests performed on reinforced sand samples, for different values of the geotextile layers number (N (g)), of confining pressure () and relative density (D (r)). The test results have shown that the contribution of the geotextile at low values of the axial strain (epsilon (1)) is negligible, for higher values of (epsilon (1)); geotextile induces a quasi-linear increase in the deviator stress (q) and leads to an increase in the volume contractiveness within the reinforced samples. A negligible influence of geotextile layers number (N (g)) on the stress-strain behaviour and the volumetric change has been shown, when normalized with N (g). The results indicate that the contribution of geotextile to the stress-strain mobilization increases with increasing confining pressure, while its contribution to the volume contraction decreases with the increase in the confining pressure.

Title:  Wildfire; Eastern Cascades; dNBR; d74; Canopy cover; Simultaneous autoregression        
Abstract: Measuring post-fire effects at landscape scales is critical to an ecological understanding of wildfire effects. Predominantly this is accomplished with either multi-spectral remote sensing data or through ground-based field sampling plots. While these methods are important, field data is usually limited to opportunistic post-fire observations, and spectral data often lacks validation with specific variables of change. Additional uncertainty remains regarding how best to account for environmental variables influencing fire effects (e.g., weather) for which observational data cannot easily be acquired, and whether pre-fire agents of change such as bark beetle and timber harvest impact model accuracy. This study quantifies wildfire effects by correlating changes in forest structure derived from multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) acquisitions to multi-temporal spectral changes captured by the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager for the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon. Spatial regression modeling was assessed as a methodology to account for spatial autocorrelation, and model consistency was quantified across areas impacted by pre-fire mountain pine beetle and timber harvest. The strongest relationship (pseudo-r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.0001) was observed between the ratio of shortwave infrared and near infrared reflectance (d74) and LiDAR-derived estimate of canopy cover change. Relationships between percentage of LiDAR returns in forest strata and spectral indices generally increased in strength with strata height. Structural measurements made closer to the ground were not well correlated. The spatial regression approach improved all relationships, demonstrating its utility, but model performance declined across pre-fire agents of change, suggesting that such studies should stratify by pre-fire forest condition. This study establishes that spectral indices such as d74 and dNBR are most sensitive to wildfire-caused structural changes such as reduction in canopy cover and perform best when that structure has not been reduced pre-fire.

Title:  second-hand smoke; pregnancy; One-Child Policy; rural China        
Abstract: Worldwide, many nonsmokers (often women and children) are exposed to second-hand smoke (SHS) in home settings, as men retain their traditional power and control within their family and women and children have limited agency to intervene. This study, set up to explore home smoking management in rural China, found that some women were able to positively intervene to restrict men's smoking at three key stages: prior to conception, during their pregnancy and at the early years of their children's lives. By utilizing dominant social, health and political narratives about the importance of raising a healthy child supported by the One-Child Policy in China, combined with the fear of health risks of SHS to young children, the women were able to use their elevated status as bearer and carers of the only children to subvert the pre-eminence of men in domestic environments, enabling them to positively influence home smoking. While this study highlights the possibility for future smoking cessation initiatives in China by incorporating family carers' elevated awareness of protection of children's health in key stages of childhood, there is also a need for further health education, as family members were unsure why they needed to keep children smoke-free, which may partially explain why few households were smoke-free.

Title:  Sports injuries; dance; case study; biomechanics        
Abstract: The purpose of this case study was to describe the three-dimensional biomechanics of common ballet exercises in a ballet dancer with ischial tuberosity apophysitis. This was achieved by comparing kinematics between the symptomatic (i.e. ischial apophyseal symptoms) and contralateral lower limbs, as well as via reported pain. Results suggest consistent differences in movement patterns in this dancer. These differences included: 1) decreased external rotation of contralateral hip, hence a decreased hip contribution to 'turn out'; 2) increased contralateral knee adduction and internal rotation; 3) an apparent synchronicity in the contralateral lower limb of the decreased hip external rotation and increased knee adduction; and 4) minimal use of ankle plantar/dorsiflexion movement for symptomatic side. Pain related to the left ischial apophysitis was associated with reduced amplitudes especially in fast ballet movements that required large range of motion in flexion and adduction in the left hip joint. These findings suggest that ischial apophysitis may limit dancer's ballet technique and performance.

Title:  Renewable energy; Hybrid system; Heat pump; Energy conversion; Energy management; Photovoltaic array        
Abstract: This study is a contribution to the analysis Of energy production by hybrid systems using renewable energy sources. It is realized within the framework of an isolated site, i.e., without any connection to an electrical network. Generally, with the conventional solutions for energy production, the needs in terms of electrical energy and thermal energy are met separately. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach based on a strategy of hybridization which uses energy conversion to meet the energy needs. In this alternative approach, a large part of the directly produced thermal energy is replaced by electrical energy and an air/water heat pump variable input power is introduced to ensure a crossover between the thermal energy flow and the electrical energy flow. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. Firstly, we propose a methodology to control the functioning of the air/water heat pump variable input power. Secondly, we compare the potential of thermal energy production of two subsystems and we show the interest of using energy conversion according to the type of climate. Thirdly, we present a case study. More precisely, the study is realized for representative locations in France. The objective is twofold. First, an analysis of the energy potential at the representative sites is given. Second, it is established that the energy produced is increased by using the hybridization strategy based on energy conversion, especially in winter which is the critical period in terms of both electrical and thermal needs. Simulation and experimental results are presented and analyzed to show the interest of introducing a pump heat in the hybrid system, mainly when using the technology with variable input power.

Title:  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension; pseudotumor cerebri; dural venous sinus stenting        
Abstract: Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome defined by elevated intracranial hypertension without radiographic evidence of a mass lesion in the brain. Dural venous sinus stenosis has been increasingly recognized as a treatable cause, and dural venous sinus stenting (DVSS) is increasingly performed. Methods: A 5 year single-center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing DVSS for medically refractory IIH. Results: There were 43 patients with a mean imaging follow-up of 6.5 months and a mean clinical follow-up period of 13.5 months. DVSS was performed as the first procedure for medically refractory IIH in 81.4% of patients, whereas 18.6% of patients included had previously had a surgical procedure (ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt or optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF)). Headache was present in all patients and after DVSS improved or remained stable in 69.2% and 30.8%, respectively. Visual acuity changes and visual field changes were present in 88.4% and 37.2% of patients, respectively. Visual field improved or remained unchanged in 92%, but worsened in 8% after stenting. There was a stent patency rate of 81.8%, with an 18.2% re-stenosis rate. Of the 43 procedures performed, there was a 100% technical success rate with zero major or minor complications. Conclusion: Based on this single-center retrospective analysis, DVSS can be performed with high technical success and low complication rates. A majority of patients presented primarily with headache, and these patients had excellent symptom relief with DVSS alone. Patients presenting with visual symptoms had lower success rates, and this population, if stented, should be carefully followed for progression of symptoms.

Title:  microRNAs; liver; viral infection; PAT proteins; lipids        
Abstract: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) promotes lipid droplet (LD) formation and perturbs the expression of the LD associated PAT proteins ADRP and TIP47, to promote its own lifecycle. HCV enhances TIP47 and suppresses ADRP by displacing it from LD surface in infected cell models. We have previously shown that suppression of TIP47 by miR-148a and miR-30a decreased intracellular LDs and HCV RNA. Thus, this study aimed at examining whether this microRNA-mediated suppression of HCV would limit HCV-dependent displacement of ADRP from LDs. ADRP expression was examined in 21 HCV-infected liver biopsies and 9 healthy donor liver tissues as well as in HCV-infected Huh7 cells using qRT-PCR. miR-148a and miR-30a expression was manipulated using specific oligos in JFH-1 infected, oleic acid treated cells, to study their impact on ADRP expression using qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Intracellular HCV RNA was assessed using qRT-PCR. ADRP is down regulated in patients as well as HCVcc-JFH-I infected cell models. Forcing the expression of both miRNAs induced ADRP on the mRNA and protein levels. This study shows that HCV suppresses hepatic ADRP expression in infected patients and cell lines. Forcing the expression of miR-148a and miR-30a limits the suppressive effect of HCV on ADRP. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title:  Visible and colorimetric aptasensor; DNA-capped SWCNTs; Exosomes        
Abstract: Recently, many studies have shown the potential use of circulating exosomes as novel biomarkers for monitoring and predicting a number of complex diseases, including cancer. However, reliable and cost-effective detection of exosomes in routine clinical settings, still remain a difficult task, mainly due to the lack of adequately easy and fast assay platforms. Therefore, we demonstrate here the development of a visible and simple method for the detection of exosomes by integrating single-walled carbon nanotubes that being excellent water solubility (s-SWCNTs) and aptamer. Aptamers, specific to exosomes transmembrane protein CD63, are absorbed onto the surface of s-SWCNTs and improve the minic peroxidase activity of s-SWCNT5, which can efficiently catalyze H2O2-mediated oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and lead to a change from colorless to blue in solution. However, after adding exosomes, the aptamers are bound with CD63, leaving from the surface of s-SWCNTs through conformational changes, which results the color of solution from deep to moderate, and this can be observed by the naked eye and monitored by UV vis spectrometry. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of exosomes is estimated to be 1.84x10(6) to 2.21x10(7) particles/mu L with a detection of limit (LOD) of 5.2x10(5) particles/mu L. Consequently, a visible and simple approach detecting exosomes is successfully constructed. Moreover, this proposed colorimetric aptasensor can be universally applicable for the detection of other targets by simple change the aptamer.

Title:  Fuzzy systems; System identification; Multivariate analysis; Clustering        
Abstract: Rule-based classification systems constructed upon linguistic terms in the antecedent and consequent of the rules lack sufficient generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a new multivariate fuzzy system identification algorithm to design binary rule-based classification structures through making use of the repulsive forces between the cluster prototypes of different class labels. This approach is coupled with the potential discrimination power of each dimension in the feature space to increase the generalization potential. To address this issue, first the multivariate variant of a newly proposed soft clustering algorithm along with its mathematical foundations is proposed. Next, the discriminatory power of each individual feature is computed, using the multivariate membership values in the proposed clustering algorithm to achieve the most accurate firing degree in each rule. The main advantage of this method is to handle unbalanced datasets yielding superior true positive measure while keeping the false positive rate low enough to avoid the natural bias toward class labels containing larger number of training samples. To validate the proposed approaches, a series of numerical experiments on publicly available datasets and a real clinical dataset collected by our team were conducted. Simulation results demonstrated achievement of the primary goals of this research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Alternative fuels; Methanol; Spark ignition engine; lso-butanol        
Abstract: Alternative fuels on internal combustion engine (ICE) recently has become an attention due to the concern for environmental protection, and needs on reducing dependency on fossil fuels and meeting the current stringent regulation. Alcohol fuel is one of the attractive alternative fuels as it can be produced from renewable resources and is oxygenated. Methanol fuel is a well-known alcohol fuel that can be blended at the lower blending ratio with gasoline and produce better engine operation in spark ignition engine. However, there is a problem related to its methanol properties, especially on its energy content and vapour lock characteristics. Alcohol with higher carbon number such as iso-butanol has high energy content and is able to displace more petroleum gasoline compared to the methanol-gasoline blended fuel. In this study, the focus on the effect of the iso-butanol additive in the methanol-gasoline fuel of unmodified spark ignition engines. A lower ratio of methanol-gasoline blends (M5) was blended with the isobutanol additive for 5 to 15% with 5% increment compared with base gasoline fuel. Tests were conducted at constant load (100%) with a variable of lower engine speed range from 1000 rpm to 2500 rpm. The results indicate that as for engine performance, M5B15 displayed improvement in engine brake power, BTE (brake thermal efficiency), and EGT (exhaust gas temperature) compared to other blended fuels. Nevertheless, there is a higher fuel consumption was recorded for all methanol-gasoline blended fuels with iso-butanol additive compared to base gasoline fuel. In terms of engine emissions, M5B15 gives a significant reduction in CO and HC emissions compared to base gasoline fuel. However, the increasing trend projected by NOx and CO2 emissions had been recorded in all iso-butanol additive in methanol gasoline fuels with M5B15 exerting the highest emissions. It can be concluded that iso-butanol additives are a viable option to be blended with existing lower ratio of methanol-gasoline for spark ignition engine operation as an alternative fuel.

Abstract: Objective: This study aimed to assess the usefulness of narrow band UVB (NB-UVB) therapy in Yemeni patients with different skin conditions. Methods: A prospective clinical audit was conducted of 120 Yemeni patients (45 males and 75 females), aged 5-54 years from all patients with different skin diseases in dermatology clinic (January 2013 -May 2014), treated by NB-UVB irradiation without being combined with topical steroid or topical chemotherapy during the course of the study. Results: 120 patients enrolled in this study with mean age 25.8 +/- 12.6 years old. Females consisted of the major rate (62.5%), and patients who came from Aden had a high rate (77.5%). Ninety four (78.3%) patients had complete response to treatment, 6.7% had partial and 15% had no response. Mycosis fungoid and atopic dermatitis had a high mean number of session (84.50 +/- 0.70), followed by vitiligo with mean number of sessions 27.10 +/- 23.70. The Lichen planus, Mycosis and Pityriasis had complete response (100%) to treatment, followed by vitiligo 79.3%, while partial response appeared in patients with alopecia (66.7%) and atopic dermatitis (22.2%). Patients with chronic renal failure had no response to treatment in 33.3%, followed by Parapsoriasis (20%). Conclusion: Our study proves that NB-UVB therapy is an effective and safe tool in the management of skin diseases and is considered the first-line phototherapeutic option for many skin conditions.

Title:  Axial spondyloarthritis; Ankylosing spondylitis; Cigarette smoking; Disease activity; Functional impairment        
Abstract: A history of ever-smoking appears to be associated with a more severe disease phenotype in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). However, evidence is sparse for the effect of increased smoking exposure on disease outcomes or whether smoking reduction or cessation improves outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore whether a dose-response relationship exists between pack-years and disease activity and functional impairment in axSpA. Consecutive patients meeting ASAS criteria for axial SpA were recruited from a spondyloarthritis service. The associations between pack-years of smoking and: (1) disease activity (BASDAI/ASDAS), (2) spinal pain, (3) functional impairment (BASFI) and (4) inflammatory markers were explored using multivariable linear models, adjusted for age, gender and use of TNF inhibition (TNFi) therapy. Pack-years were categorised into four groups (40) and analysed with light smoking (40, beta = 2.6 (0.54, 3.56)), higher BASFI (21-40, beta = 2.1 (0.42, 4.80); >40, beta = 3.2 (0.76, 5.71)), and higher ASDAS (21-40, beta = 0.82 (0.14, 1.51)). This cross-sectional study demonstrated that smoking is associated with increased axSpA severity markers in a dose-response manner. Particular effort should be made to restrict smoking exposure early before accruing a significant number of pack-years.

Title:  Antibiotic resistance; health policy; infectious disease control; public health emerging infections        
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a threat to public health and is the second cause of death due to a single infectious agent after HIV/AIDS. The worldwide distribution of TB is heterogeneous. The incidence is decreasing in most high-income regions, but the situation remains worrying in many parts of the world. The emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to key agents used in treatment (rifampin and isoniazid) contributes to TB transmission around the world. To achieve TB elimination, both high and low endemic countries must upscale their efforts to decrease disease transmission and improve cure rates. Management of drug-resistant TB is of particular importance. In this paper, we discuss the different models of care of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), the ethical considerations and the specific constraints present in high income countries. The management model chosen by the Belgian TB specialists in accordance with public health authorities as well as building of a specific MDR/XDR-TB isolation unit are also discussed.

Title:  Body dysmorphic disorder; Selective attention; Eye tracking; Bulimia nervosa; Body image        
Abstract: Objective: Cognitive behavioral models postulate that selective attention plays an important role in the maintenance of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). It is suggested that individuals with BDD overfocus on perceived defects in their appearance, which may contribute to the excessive preoccupation with their appearance. Methods: The present study used eye tracking to examine visual selective attention in individuals with BDD (n = 19), as compared to individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) (n = 21) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 21). Participants completed interviews, questionnaires, rating scales and an eye tracking task: Eye movements were recorded while participants viewed photographs of their own face and attractive as well as unattractive other faces. Results: Eye tracking data showed that BDD and BN participants focused less on their self-rated most attractive facial part than HCs. Scanning patterns in own and other faces showed that BDD and BN participants paid as much attention to attractive as to unattractive features in their own face, whereas they focused more on attractive features in attractive other faces. HCs paid more attention to attractive features in their own face and did the same in attractive other faces. Conclusion: Results indicate an attentional bias in BDD and BN participants manifesting itself in a neglect of positive features compared to HCs. Perceptual retraining may be an important aspect to focus on in therapy in order to overcome the neglect of positive facial aspects. Future research should aim to disentangle attentional processes in BDD by examining the time course of attentional processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Purpose/Objectives: This article describes the value of a clinical nurse specialist (CNS) team in partnering with interdisciplinary stakeholders to improve care for women with gynecological cancers receiving radiation via intracavitary-interstitial pelvic implants (IPI). Background: Intracavitary-interstitial pelvic implants can prolong survival but is associated with significant impacts on quality of life. Intracavitary-interstitial pelvic implants is a complex and invasive intervention that requires patients to be immobile for 3 days and creates challenges related to dignity, hygiene, nutrition, pain management, emotional health, skin care, and overall patient satisfaction. The nursing staff shared concerns with their respective CNSs regarding patients' quality of care. Lack of standardized practice/orders and gaps in knowledge created challenges. Rationale: Clinical nurse specialist practice requires collaborative efforts within the 3 spheres of influence to improve the care of patients receiving IPI therapy. Description: The CNSs recognized and addressed needs of patients/families, staff, and the organization across the continuum. The team's efforts relied on reflection of nurses' concerns, collaboration, and a unified vision for exceptional care. Outcomes: This CNS-led initiative was successful in establishing processes to ensure quality care. Improvement in patient care was achieved through creation of standardized order sets, a focused plan of care, and patient/family/staff education. Nurse satisfaction, confidence, and empowerment to provide patient care with dignity and sensitivity have been verbalized. Conclusion: The CNS team's broad scope of practice, across inpatient, outpatient, and evidence-based practice, is a strength. Key to the team's success was the recognition of challenges and a unified vision to bring together stakeholders to facilitate improvement of care. Future direction includes evaluating nutritional choices and examining psychosocial aspects of the patient's experience. An interdisciplinary nursing grand rounds is planned to highlight the outcomes of this team. Implications: The leadership of CNS teams with varied scopes is critical to affecting change within the spheres of influence and improving patient care across the continuum.

Title:  mirror neurons; synesthesia; mirror touch; motor cortex; F5; threshold theory        
Abstract: Since mirror neurons were introduced to the neuroscientific community more than 20 years ago, they have become an elegant and intuitive account for different cognitive mechanisms (e.g., empathy, goal understanding) and conditions (e.g., autism spectrum disorders). Recently, mirror neurons were suggested to be the mechanism underlying a specific type of synesthesia. Mirror-touch synesthesia is a phenomenon in which individuals experience somatosensory sensations when seeing someone else being touched. Appealing as it is, careful delineation is required when applying this mechanism. Using the mirror-touch synesthesia case, we put forward theoretical and methodological issues that should be addressed before relying on the mirror-neurons account.

Title:  cytogenetics; dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS); DIPSS-plus; International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS); mutations; myelofibrosis; prognosis        
Abstract: Primary myelofibrosis, the most aggressive of the classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), is a clonal disorder characterized by often debilitating constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis and resultant cytopenias, extramedullary hematopoiesis, risk of leukemic transformation, and shortened survival. Post-polycythemia vera and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis represent similar entities, although some differences are being recognized. Attempts to classify patients with myelofibrosis into prognostic categories have been made since the late 1980s, and these scoring systems continue to evolve as new information becomes available. Over the last decade, the molecular pathogenesis of MPNs has been elucidated considerably, and the Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is the first drug specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk myelofibrosis. This article reviews the evolution of prognostic criteria in myelofibrosis, emphasizing the major systems widely in use today, as well as recently described, novel systems that incorporate emerging data regarding somatic mutations. Risk factors for thrombosis and conversion to MPN blast phase also are discussed. Finally, the practical usefulness of the current prognostic classification systems in terms of clinical decision making is discussed, particularly within the context of some of their inherent weaknesses.

Abstract: This paper reviews sixty-nine (69) field failures involving geotextile filters which performed unsatisfgctorily and are categorized herein as failures. They are grouped into four categories; inadequate design, atypical soils, unusual permeants, and improper installation. In the first category are poor fabric selection, poor fabric design, socked drainage pipe and reversing flow conditions. In the second category are fine grained soils, gap-graded soils, dispersive clays and ochre. In the third category are sludges, turbid water, alkaline water, leachates and agricultural waste liquids. In the fourth category are lack of intimate contact and completely adhesive clogging of surfaces. While not the topic of the paper, it should be noted that, most of these same conditions are known to be troublesome to sand filters as well as to geotextile filters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title:  knowledge representation; knowledge-base systems; intelligent problem solver; automated reasoning        
Abstract: Knowledge representation plays a very important role for designing knowledge base systems as well as intelligent systems. Nowadays, there are many effective methods for representing such as: semantic network, rule-base systems, computational network. Computational Objects Knowledge Base (COKB) can be used to represent the total knowledge and design the knowledge base of systems. In fact, a popular form of knowledge domain is knowledge about operations and computational relations, especially computational knowledge domain, such as: Linear Algebra, Analytic Geometry. However, COKB model and the other models have not solved yet some problems about operators: specification of operator, properties of operator, reducing an expression. In this paper, we will present a reducing model of COKB. This model, called Ops-model, represents knowledge about operators between objects and solve some problems related to these operators. Through that, the algorithms for designing inference engine of model have been built up. Moreover, Ops-model has been applied to specify a part of knowledge domain about Direct Current (DC) Electrical Circuits and construct a program for solving some problems on this knowledge domain.

Title:  High-molecular-weight glutenin; omega-5 Gliadin; Prediction model; Wheat allergy; Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis        
Abstract: As one of the eight foods that account for 90 % of food allergies, wheat must be excluded from the diet in patients suffering from wheat allergies. From studies of wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA), which has been used as a model to develop hypoallergenic wheat, we now know that the gluten fraction of wheat protein, particularly omega-5 gliadin and high-molecular-weight (HMW)-glutenin, is responsible for the allergic response. However, studies of allergic responses with WDEIA have been performed with a single wheat cultivar. Thus, in an effort to provide more information for the development of hypoallergenic wheat, we compared various cultivars with different countries of origin and characteristics. For the first step, we compared the allergen contents (omega-5 gliadin and HMW-glutenin) in each cultivar and the allergic response caused by each cultivar. Domestic wheat cultivars had lower contents of omega-5 gliadin and HMW-glutenin than those of imported wheat cultivars. Additionally, some cultivars caused varying allergic responses due to their allergen components. From regression analysis of allergen contents and allergic responses in vivo, we suggest a prediction model to estimate the extent of allergic response based on the omega-5 gliadin and HMW-glutenin contents. Further studies are needed to analyze the biological interactions between allergens from various cultivars and allergic response factors.

Title:  Hormonal Contraception; Emergency Contraception; Abortion        
Abstract: Family planning methods that act when administered after fertilisation would have substantial benefits: they could be used longer after sex than current emergency contraceptives, and potentially a woman could use them only on relatively rare occasions when her menstrual period is delayed. Although such methods would displease abortion opponents, they would likely be welcomed by many women. Research to develop post-fertilisation fertility control agents should be pursued.

Title:  Image steganography; Information security; Image quality; LSB; Stego key; Multimedia security; Data hiding        
Abstract: Information hiding is an active area of research where secret information is embedded in innocent-looking carriers such as images and videos for hiding its existence while maintaining their visual quality. Researchers have presented various image steganographic techniques since the last decade, focusing on payload and image quality. However, there is a trade-off between these two metrics and keeping a better balance between them is still a challenging issue. In addition, the existing methods fail to achieve better security due to direct embedding of secret data inside images without encryption consideration, making data extraction relatively easy for adversaries. Therefore, in this work, we propose a secure image steganographic framework based on stego key-directed adaptive least significant bit (SKA-LSB) substitution method and multi-level cryptography. In the proposed scheme, stego key is encrypted using a two-level encryption algorithm (TLEA); secret data is encrypted using a multi-level encryption algorithm (MLEA), and the encrypted information is then embedded in the host image using an adaptive LSB substitution method, depending on secret key, red channel, MLEA, and sensitive contents. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results indicate that the proposed framework maintains a better balance between image quality and security, achieving a reasonable payload with relatively less computational complexity, which confirms its effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)-type equations can describe the nonlinear waves in fluids, plasmas, etc. In this paper, two generalized KdV equations are under investigation. Bilinear forms of which are constructed with the Bell polynomials and an auxiliary variable. -soliton solutions are given through the Hirota direct method. Via the asymptotic analysis, the soliton interactions of the first generalized KdV equation are analyzed, which turn out to be elastic. Singular breather solutions have been derived from the two-soliton solutions. The collision between soliton and singular breather appears to be elastic, and the bound states of soliton and singular breather are exhibited. Unlike the first one, the other generalized KdV equation can only support the bound states of solitons, for the regular and singular solitons alike.

Title:  Borderline personality disorder; Comorbidity; National health insurance database; Data mining association rules        
Abstract: Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex clinical state with highly polymorphic symptoms and signs. Studies have demonstrated that people with a BPD diagnosis are likely to have numerous co-occurring psychiatric disorders and physical comorbidities. The aim of our study was to obtain further insight about the associations among comorbidities of BPD and to demonstrate the practicality of using association rule mining (ARM) technique in clinical databases. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted on information of 1460 patients (292 BPD patients and 1168 control patients) selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Information on physical and psychiatric comorbidities, which were diagnosed within 3 years before and after enrollment, was collected. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratios of comorbidities between patients with and without BPD. ARM technique was used to study the associations of BPD and two or more psychiatric comorbidities. Results: We classified physical comorbidities into 13 categories according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification system, and the results indicated that the 12 categories were more common in the BPD patients than in the control patients (except congenital anomalies). However, psychiatric comorbidities, including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, substance use disorder, and mental retardation were more common in the BPD patients than in the control patients. Furthermore, the associations of BPD and two or more comorbidities were evaluated. Conclusion: Most physical and psychiatric disorders were more common in the BPD patients than in the control patients. Because the failure to remit from BPD is associated with suffering from chronic physical conditions and because psychiatric comorbidities may lead to delays in diagnosis of BPD, clinicians caring for people with BPD should be aware of possible comorbidities.

Title:  dementia; decision making; caregiving; person-centered care        
Abstract: This study describes engagement of veterans with dementia in an evidence-based care coordination intervention called Partners in Dementia Care (PDC). PDC uses a person-centered approach that encourages participation by individuals with dementia (IWDs), despite their cognitive impairment. PDC also targets primary family or friend caregivers, who often are the main user of the program. Of the total 316 IWDs, 202 passed a mental status screening and were considered to have engagement potential. The study of actual engagement was based on data from IWDs' PDC records, combined with data from structured research interviews. Approximately 80% of IWDs with engagement potential had a minimum level of actual engagement in PDC. A smaller subsample was more actively engaged, as indicated by assigned and/or accomplished action steps. Younger IWDs and those self-reporting more memory difficulties had higher levels of engagement. Results describe one example of the extent and limits of IWD engagement in psychosocial interventions.

Title:  Visual cryptography; Cover image; Stego image; Galois field arithmetic        
Abstract: Nowadays, the most important study to provide confidentiality is digital image encryption. More and more proposals have been committed to inquire about Visual Secret Sharing (VSS) techniques. Traditional scheme was mainly focused on binary images and later investigations were extended to grayscale and color images. Visual cryptography encodes the secret information into n shares and distribute among of group of participants. Qualified participants can reconstruct the original image by superimposing the collected share images. Regrettably, the previous schemes still have weakness during the construction of secret shares and reconstruction on secret image. In this paper we present a reversible visual cryptography technique for color images using Galois field theory. A secret image is split up into two sub images and shared by the cover image to construct the stego images. Additionally Galois field theory is applied to construct brother stego images for effective transmission. Individual stego and brother stego images reveal nothing. The Galois field inverse operation of exponential is employed to reveal the secret image and pair of pixels in the brother stego images reveals cover images.

Title:  Spoofing Attacks; Received Signal Strength (RSS); Mean Shift Algorithm; Localization; DANN        
Abstract: Wireless networks have gained immense popularity in recent years. Though wireless networks have innumerous advantages over conventional wired networks, the borderless nature of wireless networks makes it prone to various felonious activities. In the context of network security, one of the most crucial vulnerabilities which have caused a serious global concern is the MAC Address Spoofing. MAC address spoofing facilitates launching of other attacks such as Denial-of-service, Man-in-the-middle, SYN flooding etc. In this paper we propose a methodology for the detection of spoofing attacks in IEEE 802.11 networks that involve performance of cluster analysis on RSS patterns of 802.11 transmitters which not only detect presence of a spoofing attack but also determine number of attackers. Further for localizing the adversaries, we propose a discriminant-adaptive neural network (DANN) based localization system.

Title:  Immunology; Cancer; Immune surveillance; Escape; Immune suppression        
Abstract: Despite having been much debated, it is now well established that the immune system plays an essential role in the fight against cancer. In this article, we will highlight the implication of the immune system in the control of tumor growth and describe the major components of the immune system involved in the antitumoral immune response. The immune system, while exerting pressure on tumor cells, also will play a pro-tumoral role by sculpting the immunogenicity of tumors cells as they develop. Finally, we will illustrate the numerous mechanisms of immune suppression that take place within the tumoral microenvironment which allow tumor cells to escape control from the immune system. The increasingly precise knowledge of the brakes to an effective antitumor immune response allows the development of immunotherapy strategies more and more innovating and promising of hope.

Title:  Orientia tsutsugamushi; real-time PCR; scrub typhus        
Abstract: Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is a common cause of acute undifferentiated febrile illness in the Asia-Pacific region. However, its nonspecific clinical manifestation often prevents early diagnosis. We propose the use of PCR and serologic tests as diagnostic tools. Here, we developed a multiplex real-time PCR assay using hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes targeting O. tsutsugamushi 47-kDa, groEL, and human interferon beta (IFN-beta gene) genes to improve early diagnosis of scrub typhus. The amplification efficiency was higher than 94%, and the lower detection limit was 10 copies per reaction. We used a human gene as an internal DNA quality and quantity control. To determine the sensitivity of this PCR assay, we selected patients with confirmed scrub typhus who exhibited a clear 4-fold increase in the level of IgG and/or IgM. The PCR assay result was positive in 45 of 52 patients, indicating a sensitivity of 86.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74.2 to 94.4). The PCR assessment was negative for all 136 non-scrub typhus patients, indicating a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 97.3 to 100). In addition, this test helped diagnose patients with inconclusive immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results and using single blood samples. In conclusion, the real-time PCR assay proposed here is sensitive and specific in diagnosing scrub typhus. Combining PCR and serologic tests will improve the diagnosis of scrub typhus among patients presenting with acute febrile illness.

Title:  Adaptive immune system; Autism spectrum disorders; Behavior; Cerebellum; Cytokine; Innate immune system; Immunity; Maternal immune activation; Neuroimmunology; Social interactions; T cells; Gastrointestinal        
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are developmental disorders characterized by behavioral deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication as well as social interactions, and are accompanied by repetitive or stereotyped behaviors and interests. Numerous studies over the last forty years have recognized altered immune responses in individuals with ASD; concurrently basic research has highlighted the myriad of neuroimmune interactions and the cross talk that occurs between nervous and immune systems. Neuroinflammation, particularly in the cerebellum, has been found in post mortem brain tissues from individuals with ASD and is characterized by the presence of profound glia activation processes. This and altered gene expression profiles indicating perturbed immune suggest a contributing role for immunological systems in the pathology of ASD. Peripheral immune abnormalities have also been found; shifts in both direction of Th1 and Th2 skewing have been reported as well as autoantibody production, increased NK cell activation, T cell responses and monocyte cell function overwhelmingly suggesting the presence of immune dysfunction in individuals with ASD. Many of these findings are associated with worsening behavioral scores, suggesting treatment of immune function could be useful in alleviating symptoms associated with ASD. Immune activation in utero is also associated with an increased risk of the child for having a diagnosis of ASD, where increased cytokine production in the offspring is directly linked to changes in offspring behavior. In addition to peripheral changes, brain and CSF immune variations in ASD are reported as well as an increase in gastrointestinal/mucosal dysfunction which has led to an increased interest in exploring the gut-brain-immune connections and its role in ASD. Further research in neuroimmune interactions may bring further insight and elicit new therapeutic tools for ASD.

Abstract: An universal multi input single output type multifunction biquad is proposed. The proposed configuration employs only one current differencing transconductance amplifier as the active element, two capacitors and three resistors. The circuit realizes all five filter functions (i.e. Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Notch and All Pass) without changing the circuit topology. The natural frequency omega(0) is independently and electronically tunable. The workability of the proposed multifunction biquad has been verified using SPICE simulation.

Abstract: Nowadays, the protection and the security of data transited within computer networks represent a real challenge for developers of computer applications and network administrators. The Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Prevention System are the reliable techniques for a Good security. Any detected intrusion is based on data collection. So, the collection of an important and significant traffic on the monitored systems is an interesting feature. Thus, the first task of Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Prevention System is to collect information's basis to treat and analyze them, and to make accurate decisions. Network analysis can be used to improve networks performances and their security, but it can also be used for malicious tasks. Our main goal in this article is to design a reliable and powerful network sniffer, called PcapSockS, based on pcap language and sockets, able to intercept traffic in three modes: connected, connectionless and raw mode. We start with the performances assessment performed on a list of most expanded and most recently used network sniffers. The study will be completed by a classification of these sniffers related to computer security objectives based on parameters library (libpcap/winpcap or libnet), filtering, availability, software or hardware, alert and real time. The PcapSockS provides a nice performance integrating reliable sniffing mechanisms that allow a supervision taking into account some low and high-level protocols for TCP and UDP network communications.

Title:  Chrysanthemum indicum; tyrosinase; cosmetic formulation; melanogenesis; skin physiology        
Abstract: BackgroundChrysanthemum indicum, an oriental medicinal plant, has been shown to display a variety of pharmacological activities including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. AimsIn this study, we evaluated the ability of C. indicum extracts to inhibit in vitro tyrosinase activity and the skin care effects of cosmetic formulations containing 0.5% C. indicum water extract in human volunteers. Patients/MethodsThe formation of dopachrome from (L)-dopa by mushroom tyrosinase was observed after treatments with C. indicum extracts. The volunteers received placebo (no extract) or test (0.5% C. indicum water extract) cosmetic cream and applied it on their face three times a day for 6 weeks. Biophysical skin parameters were measured every 2 weeks. ResultsChrysanthemum indicum methanol and water extracts dose dependently inhibited mushroom tyrosinase activity, and the effects of methanol extract were similar to those of kojic acid, a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor. Clinical evaluations revealed that application of cosmetic formulations containing C. indicum water extract time dependently reduced melanin levels over 6 weeks, whereas the placebo group showed no effect. No changes in moisture, elasticity, wrinkles, evenness, and pore size were observed in either group. HPLC-DAD-ESIMS analyses revealed that luteolin and acacetin-7-O-rutinoside are the major flavonoid compounds in C. indicum water extract. ConclusionThese results suggest that C. indicum water extract could be applied as a natural skin-whitening agent for functional cosmetic uses, due to its melanin-reducing efficacy.

Title:  Sentiment analysis; Natural language processing; Opinion mining; Machine learning; Support vector machine        
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an active research area in today's era due to the abundance of opinionated data present on online social networks. Semantic detection is a sub-category of sentiment analysis which deals with the identification of sentiment orientation in any text. Many sentiment applications rely on lexicons to supply features to a model. Various machine learning algorithms and sentiment lexicons have been proposed in research in order to improve sentiment categorization. Supervised machine learning algorithms and domain specific sentiment lexicons generally perform better as compared to the unsupervised or semi-supervised domain independent lexicon based approaches. The core hindrance in the application of supervised algorithms or domain specific sentiment lexicons is the unavailability of sentiment labeled training datasets for every domain. On the other hand, the performance of algorithms based on general purpose sentiment lexicons needs improvement. This research is focused on building a general purpose sentiment lexicon in a semi-supervised manner. The proposed lexicon defines word semantics based on Expected Likelihood Estimate Smoothed Odds Ratio that are then incorporated with supervised machine learning based model selection approach. A comprehensive performance comparison verifies the superiority of our proposed approach.

Title:  Bioinformatics; genomics        
Abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) constitute the most dynamic and the largest component of large plant genomes: for example, 80% to 90% of the maize genome and the wheat genome may be TEs. De novo TE annotation is therefore a computational challenge, and we investigated, using current tools in the REPET package, new strategies to overcome the difficulties. We tested our methodological developments on the sequence of the chromosome 3B of the hexaploid wheat; this chromosome is similar to 1 Gb, one of the ""fattest"" genomes ever sequenced. We successfully established various strategies for annotating TEs in such a complex dataset. Our analyses show that all of our strategies can overcome the current limitations for de novo TE discovery in large plant genomes. Relative to annotation based on a library of known TEs, our de novo approaches improved genome coverage (from 84% to 90%), and the number of full length annotated copies from 14 830 to 15905. We also developed two new metrics for qualifying TE annotation: NTE50 involves measuring the number, and LTE50 the smallest sizes of annotations that cover 50% of the genome. NTE50 decreased the number of annotations from 124868 to 93633 and LTE50 increased it from 1839 to 2659. This work shows how to obtain comprehensive and high-quality automatic TE annotation for a number of economically and agronomically important species.

Title:  rating leniency; work performance; personality; extroversion; Agreeableness; Big Five personality traits; self-rating; others rating        
Abstract: Some researchers assume that employees' personality characteristics affect leniency in rating others and themselves. However, little research has investigated these two tendencies at the same time. In the present study we developed one index for other-rating leniency and another one for self-rating leniency. Based on a review of the literature, we hypothesized that a generous assessment of peers would more likely be made by those who are extroverted and agreeable than by those who are not. Furthermore, a generous assessment of oneself would more likely be made by people who are conscientious and emotionally stable, than by people who are not. We also investigated if the leniency in rating others and the leniency in rating oneself are part of a more general leniency tendency. Data collected from a sample of real estate dealers provided support for the above hypotheses. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.

Title:  Surfaces; Deformation and fracture; Polymers; Laminates        
Abstract: Cutting strength is proposed as a new indicator of the resistance of materials to cutting. This indicator is the ratio of the cutting force in the orthogonal cutting and the cross section of the part of the specimen to be cut. It essentially depends only on the property of the material and is independent of the cutting width or depth. It can also give an indication of the resistance of surfaces to scratching. 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Discrete event systems (DES); events estimation; Petri net (PN) models        
Abstract: Event sequences estimation is an important issue for fault diagnosis of Discrete event systems, so far as fault events cannot directly be measured. This paper is about event sequences estimation with Petri net models. Events are assumed to be represented with transitions, and firing sequences are estimated from measurements of the marking variation. Estimation with and without measurement errors are discussed in n-dimensional vector space over alphabet Z(3) = {-1, 0, 1}. Sufficient conditions and estimation algorithms are provided. Performance is evaluated, and the efficiency of the approach is illustrated on two examples from manufacturing engineering.

Title:  Condition monitoring; electrical generator; signal processing; wind energy; wind turbines        
Abstract: With an increasing number of wind turbines being erected offshore, there is a need for cost-effective, predictive, and proactive maintenance. A large fraction of wind turbine downtime is due to bearing failures, particularly in the generator and gearbox. One way of assessing impending problems is to install vibration sensors in key positions on these subassemblies. Such equipment can be costly and requires sophisticated software for analysis of the data. An alternative approach, which does not require extra sensors, is investigated in this paper. This involves monitoring the power output of a variable-speed wind turbine generator and processing the data using a wavelet in order to extract the strength of particular frequency components, characteristic of faults. This has been done for doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs), commonly used in modern variable-speed wind turbines. The technique is first validated on a test rig under controlled fault conditions and then is applied to two operational wind turbine DFIGs where generator shaft misalignment was detected. For one of these turbines, the technique detected a problem 3 months before a bearing failure was recorded.

Title:  Operational modal analysis; Blind source separation; Output-only identification; System identification; Structural dynamics; Inverse problems; Higher-order and second-order statistics; Tensor methods; Joint approximate diagonalization        
Abstract: Output-only modal identification has seen significant activity in recent years, especially in large-scale structures where controlled input force generation is often difficult to achieve. This has led to the development of new system identification methods which do not require controlled input. They often work satisfactorily if they satisfy some general assumptions - not overly restrictive - regarding the stochasticity of the input. Hundreds of papers covering a wide range of applications appear every year related to the extraction of modal properties from output measurement data in more than two dozen mechanical, aerospace and civil engineering journals. In little more than a decade, concepts of blind source separation (BSS) from the field of acoustic signal processing have been adopted by several researchers and shown that they can be attractive tools to undertake output only modal identification. Originally intended to separate distinct audio sources from a mixture of recordings, mathematical equivalence to problems in linear structural dynamics have since been firmly established. This has enabled many of the developments in the field of BSS to be modified and applied to output-only modal identification problems. This paper reviews over hundred articles related to the application of BSS and their variants to output only modal identification. The main contribution of the paper is to present a literature review of the papers which have appeared on the subject. While a brief treatment of the basic ideas are presented where relevant, a comprehensive and critical explanation of their contents is not attempted. Specific issues related to output-only modal identification and the relative advantages and limitations of BSS methods both from theoretical and application standpoints are discussed. Gap areas requiring additional work are also summarized and the paper concludes with possible future trends in this area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The bridge section is subject to grid generated flow turbulence. Two grids are used one is a standard biplanar grid, while the second is a new design that provides larger turbulence length scales. The buffet response results are compared with admittances calculated using unsteady, three-dimensional, lifting-surface theory that extends standard two-dimensional Sears' theory. The bridge deck heave and pitch responses are predicted with comparisons made with wind tunnel measurements. In order to suppress buffeting, and increase the deck's critical flutter speed, the deck model is fitted with controllable leading- and trailing-edge flaps. Two sets of passive controllers, which use the flap angles as the control inputs, are demonstrated and evaluated for their capability to suppress the buffet response of the deck and increase its critical flutter speed. The first set of controllers sense the deck's position (pitch angle and heave, or pitch angle alone), whilst the second set (which are mechanical controllers) sense the vertical velocity of the flap hinge points. The control system design problem is solved as a mixed H-2/H-infinity optimisation problem. The wind tunnel experiments show that these control systems can reduce considerably the deck's buffet response, whilst simultaneously increasing its critical flutter speed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title:  Nrf2; EAE; IL-17; IL-6        
Abstract: The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized by progressive demyelination and neurodegeneration induced by inflammation and oxidative stress. The induction of Nrf2 signaling has been shown to inhibit disease development and progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS in mice. In the present study, we performed a high-throughput screening assay using a chimeric construct of the N-terminal portion of Nrf2 fused to LacZ. Using this approach, we identified the novel Nrf2 inducer TFM-735. Using human primary cell profiling systems, we found that TFM-735 inhibited T cell proliferation and exerted immuno-modulatory effects by inhibiting the production of IL-6 and IL-17. TFM-735 also inhibited IL-17 secretion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. In EAE mice treated with TFM-735, the expression of the Nrf2 target gene Nqol increased in the brain and spleen, disease severity was ameliorated, and plasma IL-17 levels decreased. Furthermore, TFM-735 inhibited luciferase activity in Wim-6 transgenic EAE mice expressing the human interleukin 6-luciferase (hfL6-BAC-Luc) reporter. Therefore, these findings indicate that TFM-735 is a potent Nrf2 inducer that inhibits inflammatory cytokine production and disease progression in mice with EAE and that TFM-735 is a promising therapeutic agent for MS.

Title:  capillary electrophoresis; catalytic heterogeneity; E. coli beta-galactosidase; electrophoretic heterogeneity; heat shock; single molecule enzymology; thermal denaturation        
Abstract: beta-Galactosidase was induced in a wild-type and an rpsL mutant E. coli at 37 and 42 degrees C (heat shock). The samples were subjected to capillary electrophoresis-based single enzyme molecule assays and the distribution of the populations' catalytic rates and electrophoretic mobilities were determined. The populations were found to differ significantly with respect to both properties which is consistent with conformational differences between molecules being an underlying basis for enzyme heterogeneity. The samples were also subjected to partial thermal denaturation which, in all but one population, led to a decrease in average activity and a decrease in variance. Furthermore, it was found that the electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme was altered by the presence of citrate in the buffer system, likely due to nonspecific binding.

Title:  Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver cirrhosis; rs12979860; Interleukin-28B; Gene polymorphism        
Abstract: Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with progressive hepatic fibrosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. The interleukin-28B (IL28B) rs12979860 polymorphism is associated with fibrosis progression in chronic HCV infection. IL28B encodes interferon-lambda, which has both antiviral and anti-proliferative properties. This study aimed to determine whether IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism is also associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma both in chronic HCV infection and in non-viral-related cirrhosis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and melting curve analyses were used to genotype 311 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCV cirrhosis (n = 202) or alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 109). HCV patients were older (p = 0.012) and less likely males (p < 0.001) than patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. IL28B rs12979860 TT genotype [OR 6.08, 95 % CI 2.11-17.53; p < 0.001] and T allele carriage (CT + TT; OR 2.3, CI 95 % 1.42-3.72; p = 0.001) were more frequent among HCV patients and, among them, more common in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (CT + TT; OR 1.79, CI 95 % 1.03-3.09; p = 0.009). Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was higher in HCV cirrhosis (OR 2.7, CI 95 % 1.5-4.7; p < 0.001), with no differences according to HCV genotype. IL28B genotype distribution was similar among patients with or without hepatocellular carcinoma, in both HCV patients regardless viral genotype (p = 0.84) and alcoholic patients (p = 0.91). Multivariate analysis showed that older age (OR 1.06, CI 95 % 1.02-1.1; p = 0.003) and male gender (OR 2.49, CI 95 % 1.24-5; p = 0.01) were independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in HCV patients. In summary, the current study did not find a significant association between IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism and hepatocarcinogenesis.

Title:  Aircraft engine hot section blades; Coordinate measuring technique; Geometric accuracy analysis        
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present coordinate measuring system possibilities in the meaning of the geometric accuracy assessment of hot zone elements in aircraft engines. The aim of the paper is to prove that this method, which uses blue light and is most sufficient and cost-saving method, can to be used in the production line for serial manufacturing of elements, for which a high level of accuracy is required. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of the geometric accuracy of the blades was performed using non-contact optical coordinate scanner ATOS Triple Scan II Blue Light, manufactured by GOM Company, at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Rzeszow University of Technology. Geometric analysis was conducted for blades manufactured from different waxes (A7Fr/60 and RealWax VisiJet CPX200), thus comparing injection technique and rapid prototyping (RP) method, and for casting made of Inconel 713C nickel-based superalloy. Findings - The analysis of the criteria for the method of blades' measuring selection showed that the chosen system successfully met all criteria for the verification of blades' geometry at the selected stages of the process. ATOS II optical scanner with blue light technology allows measurement almost regardless of daylight or artificial (white) light. This allows the application of the measurement system in the production cycle, thus eliminating the need to create special conditions for measurements. Practical implications - Requirements related to the accuracy of measured values, diversity and allowable measurement time are linked with the methods of production. Modern manufacturing methods based on computer-aided design systems/manufacturing/engineering systems require a non-contact optical measurement method based on the computer-aided-based coordinate measuring technique. In case of the non-contact optical scanning method based on the ATOS GOM measuring system, time and measurement costs depend on the methodology of measurement and the possibility of its automation. This is why the presented paper has a practical impact on possibilities for the automation of geometric accuracy measurements of obtained elements in the series production line. Social implications - The use of ATOS Triple Scan II Blue Light by GOM Company allows the reduction of cost and time of production because of the possibility of the introduction of this system in an automated production line. Additionally, the measurement of hot section blades of aircraft engines by using the blue light method is much more accurate and has implication as it impacts safety of further used manufactured elements. Originality/value - This paper presents the possibility of using the ATOS Triple Scan II Blue Light measuring system for geometric accuracy measurements in case of hot section blades of aircraft engines. This research is original because it describes three model geometric accuracy measurements, wax model obtained using the injection technique, wax model obtained using the I RP process and casting made of Inconel 713C nickel-based superalloy.

Title:  Hexagonal boron nitride; Etching; Transition metal oxide; Vacancy; Catalytic oxidation        
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a ceramic compound which is thermally stable up to 1000 C-omicron in air. Due to this, it is a very challenging task to etch h-BN under air atmosphere at low temperature. In this study, we report that h-BN flakes can be easily etched by oxidation at 350 C-omicron under air atmosphere in the presence of transition metal (TM) oxide. After selecting Co, Cu, and Zn elements as TM precursors, we simply oxidized h-BN sheets impregnated with the TM precursors at 350 C-omicron in air. As a result, microscopic analysis revealed that an etched structure was created on the surface of h-BN flakes regardless of catalyst type. And, X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that the air oxidation led to the formation of Co3O4, CuO, and ZnO from each precursor. Thermogravimetric analysis showed a gradual weight loss in the temperature range where the weight of h-BN flakes increased by air oxidation. As a result of etching, pore volume and pore area of h-BN flakes were increased after catalytic oxidation in all cases. In addition, the surface of h-BN flakes became highly active when the h-BN samples were etched by Co3O4 and CuO catalysts. Based on these results, we report that h-BN flakes can be easily oxidized in the presence of a catalyst, resulting in an etched structure in the layered structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: The current study was assigned to evaluate the total phenol, total flavonoid content (TPC, TFC) and antioxidant properties of extracts from the aerial parts of Scrophularia frigida (S. frigida). Extracts were also tested by preliminary phytochemical screening as well as cytotoxic activity against Artemia salina, MCF-7 (human breast carcinoma) and SW-480 (colon carcinoma) and L-929 (normal) cell lines along with antimicrobial characteristic. DPPH, MTT and Brine shrimp lethality tests and disc diffusion method were carried out to determine the biological activities of the different extracts of S. frigida. In addition, the extracts which had more potent antioxidant and antiproliferative activity were further analyzed by NMR and GC-MS. 40% methanol-water (from MeOH extract) fraction showed higher amounts of TPC, TFC and antioxidant property. Findings of the study for general toxicity effect showed that dichloromethane (DCM) and MeOH extracts had weak to moderate effects. Furthermore, DCM extract indicated the most potent anti-proliferative activity against cancer cell lines. No evidence of antibacterial activity was determined. On the other hand, analysis of the potent extract DCM in cytotoxic assay showed the presence of trans-phytol and cis-oleic acid in GCMS. Furthermore, NMR analysis of potent methanolic fractions in antioxidant tests revealed the presence of iridoids and phenolics. Generally, the results of TPC, TFC and antioxidant activity of extracts and fractions were in agreement with each other.

Title:  Parkinson's disease model; glutathione depletion model; HIF prolyl hydroxylase; lipoxygenase; fisetin; luteolin; Keap1        
Abstract: Flavonoids are known to trigger the intrinsic genetic adaptive programs to hypoxic or oxidative stress via estrogen receptor engagement or upstream kinase activation. To reveal specific structural requirements for direct stabilization of the transcription factors responsible for triggering the antihypoxic and antioxidant programs, we studied flavones, isoflavones and catechols including dihydroxybenzoate, didox, levodopa, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), using novel luciferase-based reporters specific for the first step in HIF1 or Nrf2 protein stabilization. Distinct structural requirements for either transcription factor stabilization have been found: as expected, these requirements for activation of HIF ODD-luc reporter correlate with in silico binding to HIF prolyl hydroxylase. By contrast, stabilization of Nrf2 requires the presence of 3,4-dihydroxy- (catechol) groups. Thus, only some but not all flavonoids are direct activators of the hypoxic and antioxidant genetic programs. NDGA from the Creosote bush resembles the best flavonoids in their ability to directly stabilize HIF1 and Nrf2 and is superior with respect to LOX inhibition thus favoring this compound over others. Given much higher bioavailability and stability of NDGA than any flavonoid, NDGA has been tested in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-animal model of Parkinson's Disease and demonstrated neuroprotective effects.

Title:  Health coaching; Pharmacist; Motivational interviewing; Community pharmacy; Depression        
Abstract: This paper describes a provider-patient communication process, which although not new to health care in general, is new to the pharmacy profession. Health coaching is a technique that empowers patients to make lasting health behavior changes that improve overall well-being. It provides patients with health care implementation options that better suit their lifestyle and abilities. Health coaching programs have the potential to foster better health outcomes, especially with patients who are chronically ill or represent an at risk population for medication non-adherence (e.g. elderly, patients on psychotropic medications). Other health professions (e.g. nursing and medicine) have had success with the implementation of health coaching models. For example, nurse coaching is recognized by the American Nurse Association and recent statistics show 3.1 million nurses in the U.S.A are also trained in nurse coaching. The pharmacy profession has yet to tap the patient-related benefits of health coaching. This commentary will discuss (i) The theoretical foundations of health coaching (ii) Distinctions between health coaching, motivational interviewing and traditional medication therapy counseling (iii) Training necessary for health coaching; and (iv) How pharmacists can use health coaching in practice.

Title:  Fungal infection; Galactomannan; Glucan; Pediatrics        
Abstract: The relationship among (1,3)-beta-D-glucans (BG), galactomannan (GM), and the risk of developing invasive fungal infections (IFI) has been observed in adult ICU and in children with hematological malignancies. Only scant data evaluated the value of BG/GM assays for diagnosis of IFI in patients with nonhema-tological diseases in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). In this study, we assessed the diagnostic value of these markers for IFI in PICU. The records of 230 patients were retrospectively evaluated. Out of 117 patients (7 proven, 23 probable, and 87 cases without evidence of IFI) performed GM and BG assays. The results showed many factors were associated with false-positive test results. Patients who aged over 3 years had higher levels of GM and BG than younger infants. The levels of BG were higher in subjects with dairy, human blood products, antibiotics, and corticosteroids therapy than in cases without these treatments. Unlike BG assay, GM assay was less susceptible to above-mentioned factors expect blood products. The levels of BG and GM in IFI cases were dramatically higher than in controls. The diagnostic performance of these assays showed that GM assay had better results when compared with BG assay. On the whole, negative predictive value in both GM and BG assays was dramatically higher than other diagnostic parameters. In conclusion, BG assay was highly susceptible to many factors, and GM assay could be useful for diagnosis of IFI for its high sensitivity, but the over benefit of this assay limited in its inadequate specificity. The comparative advantage of BG and BG assays lied in excluding IFI in non-hematological PICU patients.

Title:  Creativity in counseling; feminist analysis; film review; gender roles; patriarchy        
Abstract: This commentary reviews A League of Their Own, a film that provides a fictional account of the lives of women who played in the first year of the All-American Girls' Baseball League. Set during World War II-era America, the film offers a look into the gendered lives of women seeking careers in traditionally masculine fields. The authors review the movie from a feminist media lens, with specific emphasis on how the two main characters, Dottie and Kit, ascribe to and defy gender stereotypes and gain voice and agency. Specific implications are pulled from the analysis to be used in the context of counseling women, including empowerment of female clients and establishing career identity.

Title:  Cloud computing; Cloud platform; Datastore; Key-value structured storage; Online transaction processing        
Abstract: There are many datastore systems to choose from that differ in many ways including public versus private cloud support, data management interfaces, programming languages, supported feature sets, fault tolerance, consistency guarantees, configuration, and their deployment processes. In this paper, we focus on technologies for structured data access (database/datastore systems) in cloud systems. Our goal is to simplify the use of datastore systems through automation and to facilitate their empirical evaluation using real world applications. To enable this, we provide a cloud platform abstraction layer that decouples a data access API from its implementation. Applications that use this API can use any datastore that ""plugs into"" our abstraction layer, thus enabling application portability. We use this layer to extend the functionality of multiple datastores without modifying the datastores directly. Specifically, we provide support for ACID transaction semantics for popular key-value stores (none of which provide this feature). We integrate this layer into the AppScale cloud platform-an open-source cloud platform that executes cloud applications written in Python, Java, and Go, over virtualized cluster resources and infrastructures-as-a-service (Eucalyptus, OpenStack, and Amazon EC2). We use this system to investigate the impact of extending disparate datastores via the application portability layer with distributed transaction support.

Title:  Complex system; Modeling; Identification; Classical model; Intelligent algorithm        
Abstract: The branch of complex system spans over a wide range of areas from physical and technological systems to social and biological systems. As the first step of any complex system analysis, modeling is an important task in scientific studies field. Then both the theory and practice of complex system modeling has been considered in recent years. It is well known that system identification is the theory and methods of establishing mathematical models of complex systems. Consequently, an identification approach for a class of complex nonlinear system is put forward in this paper. The idea of the identification method employs a system model composed with classical models so as to transform the system structure identification problem into a combinatorial optimization problem initially. Then, the artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm is used to synchronously implement the identification on the system's structure and parameters. Finally, in simulation, compared with other algorithm, simulation results show that the proposed scheme is feasible.

Title:  emotion regulation; parenting; agreeableness; social adjustment        
Abstract: The goal of this study was to explore associations among maternal agreeableness, child temperament (i.e., emotion dysregulation), and children's social adjustment at school. Participants were 146 children in kindergarten and Grade 1 (76 girls; M-age = 67.78 months, SD = 10.81 months). Mothers provided ratings of their own agreeableness and their child's temperament, and teachers assessed indices of children's socioemotional functioning at school. Among the results, maternal agreeableness moderated associations between child dysregulation and aspects of adjustment at school. Specifically, at higher levels of maternal agreeableness, the relations between child dysregulation and both anxiety with peers and their prosocial behavior were attenuated. Overall, the results suggest that maternal agreeableness may serve as a protective factor for dysregulated children. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Title:  reduced solutions; mismatched thermal strain (MTS) algorithm; transverse contraction strain (TCS) algorithm; weld preparation shape; hybrid stepwise approach; transient deformation; sequential model; simultaneous model        
Abstract: Major simplifications of the corresponding rigorous thermal and thermo-mechanical analyses are applied in this chapter. Transient temperature fields are replaced by fixed temperature profiles. The 'computationally efficient' (CE) methods introduce further simplifications where transverse and longitudinal thermal strains are derived from approximations embodied in the mismatched thermal strain and transverse contraction strain algorithms. In the CE 'analytical' approach, these strains are applied to linear elastic, small strain models, using conventional strength of materials techniques. In the CE 'computational' approach, the strains are applied to linear-elastic, large-strain, finite-element models. Various hybrid stepwise methods are also shown, where a measure of sequential description is included, together with the use of elasto-plastic, finite-element computation.

Title:  Building detection; Markov random field; rectangularity measure; region growing; remote sensing; shadow        
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for automated detection of buildings from single high-resolution optical images with only visible red, green, and blue bands of data. In particular, we first investigate the shadowevidence to focus on building regions. Then, a novel Markov random field (MRF)-based region growing segmentation technique is proposed. Image is oversegmented into smaller homogeneous regions that can be used to replace the rigid structure of the pixel grid. An iterative classification merging is then applied over this set of regions. At each iteration, regions are classified using a region-level MRF model, then, according to the position of shadows, regions having the same class are merged to produce new regions whose shapes are appropriate to rectangles. The final buildings are determined using a recursive minimum bounding rectangle. The experimental results prove that the proposedmethod is applicable in various areas (high dense urban, suburban, and rural) and is highly robust and reliable.

Title:  Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma; Treatment; Brentuximab vedotin; Stem cell transplant        
Abstract: Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is one of the most common peripheral T-cell lymphomas, and the incidence is higher in blacks than non-Hispanic whites. ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL are distinct subtypes that have different characteristics and clinical outcomes. Breast implant associated ALCL is a rare lymphoma that has a good survival outcome, and a recent study showed that total capsulectomy is essential for treatment. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is a standard treatment for relapsed/refractory ALCL. The response rate is high at 80-90%; however, once the disease progresses in patients on BV, survival outcome is very poor, with a median overall survival of less than two months.

Title:  Data envelopment analysis; Unions; Decentralized bargaining; Truncated regression model        
Abstract: This paper explores the link between the presence of unions in the workplace, the adoption of decentralized labor agreements and technical efficiency, using a large sample of Italian manufacturing firms. We apply the Data Envelopment Analysis, and its robust version based on bootstrap theory, to get reliable estimates of technical efficiency at the firm level in a standard first stage. We devote particular attention to the specific technology adopted, by distinguishing 20 different sector frontiers, as well as to the presence of outliers. The obtained efficiency scores are analyzed in a second stage applying a truncated regression model estimated via Maximum Likelihood, following the Simar and Wilson (2007, 2011) methodology. Our results highlight that the presence of workplace unionization decreases the level of technical efficiency, while aspects limiting the unions' power such as a strong exposure to international markets, high debt levels or the prevalence of flexible assets partially reduce the negative effect. However, when firms adopt decentralized labor contracts agreements, the effect on efficiency is positive and partially compensates the negative unions' effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Title:  anti-tumor necrosis factor; open-label extension; clinical remission; linear growth velocity        
Abstract: Background: IMAgINE 1 assessed 52-week efficacy and safety of adalimumab in children with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab for patients who entered the IMAgINE 2 extension are reported. Methods: Patients who completed IMAgINE 1 could enroll in IMAgINE 2. Endpoints assessed from weeks 0 to 240 of IMAgINE 2 were Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index remission (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index= 15 from IMAgINE 1 baseline) using observed analysis and hybrid nonresponder imputation (hNRI). For hNRI, discontinued patients were imputed as failures unless they transitioned to commercial adalimumab (with study site closure) or adult care, where last observation was carried forward. Corticosteroid-free remission in patients receiving corticosteroids at IMAgINE 1 baseline, discontinuation of immunomodulators (IMMs) in patients receiving IMMs at IMAgINE 2 baseline, and linear growth improvement were reported as observed. Adverse events were assessed for patients receiving >= 1 adalimumab dose in IMAgINE 1 and 2 through January 2015. Results: Of 100 patients enrolled in IMAgINE 2, 41% and 48% achieved remission and response (hNRI) at IMAgINE 2 week 240. Remission rates were maintained by 45% (30/67, hNRI) of patients who entered IMAgINE 2 in remission. At IMAgINE 2 week 240, 63% (12/19) of patients receiving corticosteroids at IMAgINE 1 baseline achieved corticosteroid-free remission and 30% (6/20) of patients receiving IMMs at IMAgINE 2 baseline discontinued IMMs. Adalimumab treatment led to growth velocity normalization. No new safety signals were identified. Conclusions: Efficacy and safety profiles of prolonged adalimumab treatment in children with Crohn's disease were consistent with IMAgINE 1 and adult Crohn's disease adalimumab trials.

Title:  Integration pattern; Inverted-repeat sequence; Maize dwarf mosaic virus; RNA interference; Transgene; Resistance        
Abstract: To overcome the low efficiency of agronomic protection from maize dwarf mosaic disease, susceptible maize inbred line was transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring hpRNA expression vectors containing inverted-repeat sequences of different lengths targeting coat protein gene (CP) of maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV). After PCR screening and Southern blotting, the flanking sequences of the integration sites were amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) and used for analysis of T-DNA integration patterns. The T-2 plant lines were evaluated for their MDMV resistance in field inoculation trials under two environments. Of the nineteen T-2 plant lines positive in Southern blotting, six were evaluated as resistant to MDMV, and four of them had resistance non-significantly different from the highly resistant control ""H9-21"", while the resistance of the other eleven was proved to be significantly improved when compared to their non-transformed parent line. These improvements in MDMV resistance were verified by the relative amount of virus CP gene expression measured by quantitative real time PCR. Comparing the results of Southern blotting and TAIL-PCR analysis, different integration patterns of one or two copies of the inverted-repeat sequences were identified from non-repetitive and repetitive sequences of the maize genome. The MDMV resistance mediated by RNA interference is relative to the length of the inverted-repeat sequence, the copy number of T-DNA integration and the repeatability of integration sites. A longer hpRNA expression construct shows more efficiency than a shorter one. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  high-resolution melt curve; JAK2; myeloproliferative neoplasm        
Abstract: BackgroundJanus kinase 2 (JAK2) plays an important role in normal hematopoietic growth factor signaling. The detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation (c.1849GNT, GTC TTC) is crucial for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and has become the essential criteria for diagnosis of MPN by the WHO. High-resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis is a nongel-based, closed-tube method, in which PCR amplification and subsequent analysis are sequentially performed in the well, making it more convenient than other scanning methodologies. MethodsWe evaluated JAK2 V617F mutation by HRM. Twenty-nine patients diagnosed with MPN were examined. We studied the analytical sensitivity of the HRM analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identifying the JAK2 V617F mutation. Additionally, the sensitivity of HRM analysis and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) assay was compared. ResultsThe JAK2 V617F mutation was successfully discriminated at an abundance of 6% or above in HRM analysis. Both HRM analysis and AS-PCR showed 100% accuracy with detection limits of 6% and 2.5%, respectively. ConclusionHRM analysis is a fast, simple, reliable, and nonexpensive method for the detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation. However, more validation of the detection limits of HRM analysis should be performed before declaration of the analytic sensitivity of the method.

Title:  Analgesia; Antiepileptic; Acetic acid Writhing; Hot plate; Tail flick        
Abstract: Introduction: Analgesics are commonly prescribed medications used to alleviate pain of various aetiologies without affecting the patient's consciousness. They interfere with the transmission of pain signals. A commonly used antiepileptic drug, sodium valproate has been used in various non-epileptic conditions like migraine prophylaxis and in the treatment of bipolar disorder because of the multiple mechanisms by which it acts. Docosahexanoic Acid (DHA), an omega 3 fatty acid, is known to possess analgesic activity. We planned a study to assess the effect of sodium valproate alone and in combination with DHA in rat models of pain. Aim: To evaluate the analgesic activity of sodium valproate and DHA supplementation using various experimental models in albino Wistar rats. Materials and Methods: For analgesic activity, A total of 48 adult Wistar albino rats were divided into eight groups of six rats each. Group I was control (distil water 1 ml/kg), Group II received intraperitoneal injection of tramadol (10 mg/kg), Group III, IV, V were injected intraperitoneal sodium valproate 100, 200, 400 mg/kg with distil water respectively and Group VI, VII, VIII were given sodium valproate 100, 200, 400 mg/kg plus DHA 300 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) respectively. Analgesic activity was assessed using hot plate, tail flick and acetic acid writhing models. Results: We found that sodium valproate at higher doses (400 mg/kg) used either alone along with DHA (300 mg/kg) showed statistically significant analgesic activity in comparison to control in various experimental models for assessing pain. Conclusion: Combination of sodium valproate along with DHA has shown promising analgesic activity.

Title:  Ovarian cancer; Breast cancer; Endometrial cancer; E2; P4; ER; PR        
Abstract: Sex steroids have been widely described to be associated with a number of human diseases, including hormone-dependent tumors. Several studies have been concerned about the factors regulating the availability of sex steroids and its importance in the pathophysiological aspects of the reproductive cancers in women. In premenopausal women, large fluctuations in the concentration of circulating estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) orchestrate many events across the menstrual cycle. After menopause, the levels of circulating E2 and P4 decline but remain at high concentration in the peripheral tissues. Notably, there is a strong relationship between circulating sex hormones and female reproductive cancers (e.g. ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancers). These hormones activate a number of specific signaling pathways after binding either to estrogen receptors (ERs), especially ER alpha, ER alpha 36, and ER beta or progesterone receptors (PRs). Importantly, the course of the disease will depend on particular transactivation pathway. Identifying ER- or PR-positive tumors will benefit patients in terms of proper endocrine therapy. Based on hormonal responsiveness, effective prevention methods for ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancers represent a special opportunity for women at risk of malignancies. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) might significantly increase the risk of these cancer types, and endocrine treatments targeting ER signaling may be helpful against E2-dependent tumors. This review will present the role of sex steroids and their receptors associated with the risk of developing female reproductive cancers, with emphasis on E2 levels in pre and postmenopausal women. In addition, new therapeutic strategies for improving the survival rate outcomes in women will be addressed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Notch; Strength; Metallic glass; Fracture; Plastic deformation        
Abstract: Notch is a very important geometry with widespread applications in engineering structural components. Finding a universal equation to predict the effect of notch on strength of materials is of much significance for structural design and materials selection. In the present work, we tried to find this universal equation from experimental results of metallic glasses (MGs) and other materials as well as theoretical derivations based on a universal fracture criterion (Qu and Zhang, Sci. Rep. 3 (2013) 1117). Experimental results showed that the notch effect of the studied MG was affected by the notch geometry characterized by the stress concentration factor K. As K-t becomes smaller, the notch strength ratio (NSR, which is the ratio of nominal ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the notched sample to UTS of the unnotched sample) increases. By comparing MGs with other materials like brittle ceramics and ductile crystalline metals, we find that when K-t is same, the NSR is larger for ductile metals but smaller for brittle ceramics. Theoretically, we derived a universal equation for notch effect on strength of materials: NSR = M/K-t, where M is a constant related to materials. This universal equation was found to be consistent with the experimental results.

Title:  Computer graphics; three-dimensional graphics and realism; animation        
Abstract: The motion of a thin viscous film of fluid on a curved surface exhibits many intricate visual phenomena, which are challenging to simulate using existing techniques. A possible alternative is to use a reduced model, involving only the temporal evolution of the mass density of the film on the surface. However, in this model, the motion is governed by a fourth-order nonlinear PDE, which involves geometric quantities such as the curvature of the underlying surface, and is therefore difficult to discretize. Inspired by a recent variational formulation for this problem on smooth surfaces, we present a corresponding model for triangle meshes. We provide a discretization for the curvature and advection operators which leads to an efficient and stable numerical scheme, requires a single sparse linear solve per time step, and exactly preserves the total volume of the fluid. We validate our method by qualitatively comparing to known results from the literature, and demonstrate various intricate effects achievable by our method, such as droplet formation, evaporation, droplets interaction and viscous fingering. Finally, we extend our method to incorporate non-linear van der Waals forcing terms which stabilize the motion of the film and allow additional effects such as pearling.

Title:  Manganese-enhanced MRI; smoking; nicotine; addiction; neuronal activity        
Abstract: Nicotine dependence is defined by dopaminergic neuronal activation within the nucleus accumbens (ACB) and by affected neural projections from nicotine-stimulated neurons. Control of any subsequent neural activities would underpin any smoking cessation strategy. While extensive efforts have been made to study the pathophysiology of nicotine addiction, more limited works were developed to find imaging biomarkers. If such biomarkers are made available, addictive behaviors could be monitored noninvasively. To such ends, we employed manganese (Mn2+)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to determine whether it could be used to monitor neuronal activities after acute and chronic nicotine exposure in rats. The following were observed. Mn2+ infusion identified ACB and hippocampal (HIP) neuronal activities following acute nicotine administration. Chronic exposure was achieved by week long subcutaneously implanted nicotine mini-pump. Here nicotine was shown to activate neurons in the ACB, HIP, and the prefrontal and insular cortex. These are all central nervous system reward regions linked to drug addiction. In conclusion, MEMRI is demonstrated to be a powerful imaging tool to study brain subregion specific neuronal activities affected by nicotine. Thus, we posit that MEMRI could be used to assess smoking-associated tolerance, withdrawal and as such serve as a pre-clinical screening tool for addiction cessation strategies in humans.

Title:  SEE soft error; propagation model; multi-signal flow graph        
Abstract: Aiming at evaluating the SEE performance of complex electronic system, the multi-signal flow graph (MSFG) method is adopted. Based on the theory of the MSFG, the SEE soft error propagation model is proposed, and an analysis methodology is stated. For complex electronic system which consists of VLSIs devices, such as SRAM-based FPGA, the MSFG model has been established and simulated in TEAMS software. The fault diagnosis and the average first failure time are estimated. The report indicates that the percentage fault detection is 100%, and the average first failure time of the system varies from 142.4 hours to 4116.7 days.

Abstract: Purpose - This paper aims to explore the feasibility of rapid prototyping for human hand bones and additional artery with topological preservation. Design/methodology/approach - A serial of slices derived from spiral computed tomography human hand specimen was imported into 3DSlicer 4.4.0 to obtain a three-dimensional virtual model. The model is exported as a standard template library file. Additional arteries were structured according to the atlas and the bone model. Then, a real model was printed based on the virtual model. Measurements were approached in 11 parts of the virtual and real model. Findings - There is no statistical difference between virtual and real model in 11 parts, and the topological characters were preserved. Practical implications - This method can be used in reconstruction of clinical iconological blood vessel and anatomical education. Originality/value - This paper shows that it is possible to keep the topological structure of blood vessel not only in painting but also in clinical data.

Title:  Coarse/fine stages; dual-stage positioning; flexure mechanism; integrated servo-mechanical design; mechatronics design        
Abstract: Traditionally, the coarse and fine mechanical stages within a dual-stage positioning system are designed separately without consideration about their control performance in dual-stage integration. In this paper, a flexurebased Lorentz motor fine stage is designed concurrently with a simple PID controller to perform the dual-stage positioning, based on the existing coarse stage. The design of fine stage is carried out using a proposed integrated servo-mechanical design approach, where various specifications are considered and formulated as constraints in an optimization problem. Through the approach, both the plant modal parameters and controller parameters of fine stage are concurrently solved. It demonstrates that through suitable mechanical plant design, the fine stage can fulfill various control specifications by only using a simple PID controller, e.g., to compensate sensitivity peak, maintain stability, etc. Meanwhile, the proposed design approach also ensures certain open-loop positioning performance and the decoupling property of coarse/fine stages. The prototype of designed fine stage is fabricated, and experimental investigation indicates that the sensitivity peak is effectively reduced from 14.5 dB of coarse stage to 7.1 dB in the dualstage system, and the fine stage is able to achieve submicrometer accuracy. The maximal tracking error is also reduced significantly from about 20 mu m via the coarse stage to less than 2 mu m through dual-stage positioning.

Abstract: Infection is a serious complication after implantation of total knee-prostheses. However, fungal infection is rarely found in periprosthetic joints, and in most reports, the infecting organism is a Candida species. This is a case report of infection after left knee total arthroplasty caused by Malassezia species. The patient is still undergoing antifungal therapy with voriconazole and is still being followed-up. To the authors' knowledge, the present case is the first report of Malassezia species in a patient after total knee arthroplasty.

Title:  ascorbyl palmitate; sodium ascorbyl phosphate; antioxidant activity; facial skin sebum        
Abstract: The skin is fortified with a setup of lipophilic and hydrophilic, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Ascorbyl palmitate (AP) and sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP) are reported as lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants, respectively used for skin care. Present study was aimed to assess the combined AP (in oil phase) and SAP (in aqueous phase) via multiple emulsion (ME1) for controlling sebum secretions in healthy human females. FTIR analysis of AP and SAP was performed for identification. Multiple emulsions (ME1 and control) were prepared and analyzed for physical stability. Antioxidant activities of AP, SAP as well as ME1 (with combination of these compounds) were determined by DPPH method. 11 female volunteers were included in a single-blinded, placebo-controlled, split-face comparative study. Volunteers were instructed to apply ME1 on left cheek while control (without AP and SAP) on right cheek, for a period of 90 days. A non-invasive photometric device (Sebumeter((R))) was used for the measurement of sebum secretions on both sides of the face with subsequent time intervals. A good antioxidant activity of ME1 was observed. ME1 treatments reduced significant facial sebum secretions as compared with control/placebo treatments. It was concluded that combined AP and SAP supplementations to skin proved a promising choice for controlling facial sebum secretions and could be evaluated for undesired oily skin and acne reductions for beautifying the facial appearance.

Title:  Job scheduling; Parallel computing; Performance evaluation; Backfilling; Simulator        
Abstract: Job scheduling is a very important topic in parallel systems. Although there exist algorithms that theoretically provide optimal performance, in general, they are too complex for implementation in real production systems. The simplest and most feasible approach that provides efficient and fair scheduling is backfilling. In fact, backfilling is used in many real production systems. Scheduling policies have been widely studied and discussed, but there is still a big field of research to be explored, since most scheduling algorithms are motivated by performance, but also by the psychology of queuing and the fairness concept. In this article, we propose an algorithm (fattened backfilling) that provides more backfilling opportunities, and is consequently more efficient. In particular, our algorithm allows short jobs to move forward if they do not delay the first job of the queue more than the average waiting time of the already finished jobs. The results of our simulations show a great improvement in response time and waiting time in most of the cases, with improved or similar slowdown values. Hence, we can conclude that fattened backfilling outperforms conservative and EASY backfllling, and, due to its simplicity, it is recommended for implementation in modern scheduling systems.

Title:  allergology; epidemiology; registries        
Abstract: Purpose of review Registries are useful to discover the applicability of data generated from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) into daily practice, and to search for real-life data usually not covered by them. Recent findings In allergy, registry research brought clues to important epidemiological and clinical problems hardly accessible with other methods. The increase in the asthma prevalence in Sweden in contrast with stabilization in Denmark; the association of the prevalence of asthma and environmental factors; the knowledge of existing rhinitis international guidelines, but the poorly complacence of some of their recommendations; the low epinephrine use in anaphylaxis and the difference among European and Latin American elicitors; the predominance of b lactams or NSAIDs as drug hypersensitivity reactions inducers in different regions; the fact that most of the hereditary angioedema patients were receiving long-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens; all the mentioned are clear examples of relevant and important data provided by current registries. Summary Registries in allergy enlighten knowledge in areas not covered by classical investigational methods. As the number and importance of registries is growing, its contribution to the knowledge and management of allergic diseases will increase in the near future.

Title:  COL6A6; Atopic dermatitis; Sanger sequencing; Whole-exome sequencing        
Abstract: Background: The prevalence of atopic dermatitis has increased over the last 10 years. Atopic dermatitis tends to run in families and commonly begins to manifest in childhood. The prevalence of atopic dermatitis is as high as 20% in children. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis are important. Understanding its genetic basis is also needed to facilitate early detection. Methods: To identify family-specific candidate genetic variants associated with early-onset atopic dermatitis in Koreans, we carried out whole-exome sequencing of three separate families with this condition. Additional validation was performed in 112 AD patients and 61 controls using Sanger sequencing. Results: We focused on both common functional variants with a minor allele frequency higher than 1% and rare variants with a minor allele frequency less than 1%. The relevance of the respective variants was supported by a program that could predict whether the mutations resulted in damaged protein function. Fourteen overlapping genes were identified during exome sequencing. Three variants of the COL6A6 gene appeared in all three families and were in close proximity to atopic dermatitis-related loci on chromosome 3q21. The homozygous frequency for the rs16830494 minor allele (AA) and the rs59021909 (TT) allele and the rs200963433 heterozygous (CT) frequency were all higher in AD cases compared to controls in a population-based case-control study. Conclusion: Identifying family-specific COL6A6 polymorphisms and genetic variants of other candidate genes associated with AD using WES is a novel approach. Our study suggests that COL6A6 variants may be risk factors for atopic dermatitis. This study provides a genetic basis for early-onset AD diagnosis in Korean patients and the development of new therapies.

Title:  participant sexual orientation; face processing; face recognition; face gender; gender bias        
Abstract: Research participants' sexual orientation is not consistently taken into account in experimental psychological research. We argue that it should be in any research related to participant or target gender. Corroborating this argument, an example study is presented on the gender bias in face recognition, the finding that women correctly recognize more female than male faces. In contrast, findings with male participants have been inconclusive. An online experiment (N = 1,147) was carried out, on purpose over-sampling lesbian and gay participants. Findings demonstrate that the pro-female gender bias in face recognition is modified by male participants' sexual orientation. Heterosexual women and lesbians as well as heterosexual men showed a pro-female gender bias in face recognition, whereas gay men showed a pro-male gender bias, consistent with the explanation that differences in face expertise develop congruent with interests. These results contribute to the growing evidence that participant sexual orientation can be used to distinguish between alternative theoretical explanations of given gender-correlated patterns of findings.

Title:  Physical activity; Osteoarthritis; Consensus; Population cohorts; Metabolic equivalent of task        
Abstract: Physical activity (PA) is increasingly recognised as an important factor within studies of osteoarthritis (OA). However, subjective methods used to assess PA are highly variable and have not been developed for use within studies of OA, which creates difficulties when comparing and interpreting PA data in OA research. The aim of this study was, therefore, to gain expert agreement on the appropriate methods to harmonise PA data among existing population cohorts to enable the investigation of the association of PA and OA. The definition of PA in an OA context and methods of harmonization were established via an international expert consensus meeting and modified Delphi exercise using a geographically diverse committee selected on the basis of individual expertise in physical activity, exercise medicine, and OA. Agreement was met for all aims of study: (1) The use of Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) minutes per week (MET-min/week) as a method for harmonising PA variables among cohorts; (2) The determination of methods for treating missing components of MET-min/week calculation; a value will be produced from comparable activities within a representative cohort; (3) Exclusion of the domain of occupation from total MET-min/week; (4) The need for a specific measure of joint loading of an activity in addition to intensity and time, in studies of diseases, such as OA. This study has developed a systematic method to classify and harmonise PA in existing OA cohorts. It also provides minimum requirements for future studies intending to include subjective PA measures.

Title:  sinusitis; antibacterial agents; prospective studies; outcome assessment (health care); multicenter study; endoscopy        
Abstract: Background: In addition to known concerns regarding antibiotic overuse, recent research indicates that excessive antibiotic use is associated with poorer long-term health. Given that rhinosinusitis is the leading condition accounting for antibiotic prescriptions in the ambulatory setting, we aimed to evaluate characteristics associated with greater antibiotic use in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Methods: Adult CRS patients enrolled in a prospective, multi-institutional, observational cohort study evaluating treatment outcomes were included in this analysis. Study participants were asked to report the number of days out of the previous 90 days that systemic antibiotics were taken for sinus disease. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, and measures of disease severity were evaluated. Results: A total of 561 patients from 4 institutions were included in the analysis, with mean antibiotic use of 17.4 +/- 22.4 out of the prior 90 days. No differences between antibiotic-use groups were found for objective measures of disease severity (computed tomography [CT], endoscopy, Brief Smell Identification Test [BSIT] scores), however, increased patient-reported symptom burden (22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22], Rhinosinusitis Disability Index [RSDI]) was associated with more antibiotic use. Patients reporting the most antibiotic use were older (p = 0.004) but no ethnic or gender differences were seen. Comorbid diagnoses of allergy, asthma, diabetes, depression, or fibromyalgia were not associated with increased antibiotic use. In accordance with literature recommendations, CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) patients were less likely to have used antibiotics. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) significantly decreased antibiotic use. Conclusion: Variability in antibiotic use in CRS appears to be driven by symptom burden, independent of objective measures of disease severity, patient demographics, and presence of comorbid disease. Clear guidelines are essential to define appropriate antibiotic use in CRS. (C) 2017 ARS-AAOA, LLC.

Title:  chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; children; guidelines; mucositis; paediatric oncology        
Abstract: Purpose of review Gastrointestinal side-effects, particularly with regard to alimentary tract mucositis and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), continue to be frequent and debilitating symptomatic conditions among children and adolescents receiving cytotoxic cancer therapy. Further avenues of progress for mucositis and CINV prevention in paediatric oncology setting are warranted. Recent findings The current article reviews the major guidelines and literature published in 2016 pertaining to the prevention of mucositis and CINV. Considerable professional organizational efforts have been made to develop consensus-based or evidence-based guidelines that periodically update to define basic standards of mucositis and CINV prevention. There are a few published works in 2016 that may contribute to the emerging evidence on prevention of mucositis and CINV in the paediatric setting for future guideline updates. Summary The concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone are effective to prevent acute and delayed CINV in children who are to receive highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Optimal control of acute and delayed CINV can prevent anticipatory CINV. Oral care protocols would be beneficial to prevent mucositis in children across all cancer treatment modalities. Cryotherapy or low-level light therapy may be applied to cooperative children undergoing chemotherapy or haematological stem cell transplant conditioning regimens with a high rate of mucositis.

Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) encompasses non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) in individuals without established radiographic changes but with other clinical/imaging axSpA features and AS in those with definite sacroiliac joint changes on pelvic X-rays. A broad consensus about the management of nr-axSpA is emerging among clinicians, but the evidence base remains open to question. To explore whether nr-axSpA and AS should be treated similarly, we examined the literature on their prevalence, natural history, disease burden, and treatment. There is strong evidence that nr-axSpA and AS are expressions of the same disease. Approximately 10% of patients with nr-axSpA will develop radiographic disease over 2 years; after >20 years, the figure may exceed 80%. Nr-axSpA patients have lower CRP and less spinal inflammation on MRI than AS patients but similar disease activity, pain, and quality-of-life impairment. Most patients with nr-axSpA manage well with conservative treatment, but a minority has severe disabling symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy has demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in nr-axSpA and AS. Current evidence does not clearly indicate that anti-TNF treatment can inhibit or limit bony progression of AS, the basis of conservative and anti-TNF treatment is control of symptoms and function. For some patients with nr-axSpA, the need for powerful treatments is as great as in some with AS; thus, treatment of axSpA should be consistent across the axSpA spectrum with anti-TNF agents being available, irrespective of radiographic change, according to the same criteria as those applied to AS.

Title:  Benzene; Formaldehyde; Cancer risk; Human exposure        
Abstract: In the present study, the results of a measurement campaign aiming to assess cancer risk among two special groups of population: policemen and laboratory technicians exposed to the toxic substances, benzene and formaldehyde are presented. The exposure is compared to general population risk. The results show that policemen working outdoor (traffic regulation, patrol on foot or in vehicles, etc.) are exposed at a significantly higher benzene concentration (3-5 times) than the general population, while the exposure to carbonyls is in general lower. The laboratory technicians appear to be highly exposed to formaldehyde while no significant variation of benzene exposure in comparison to the general population is recorded. The assessment revealed that laboratory technicians and policemen run a 20% and 1% higher cancer risk respectively compared to the general population. Indoor working place air quality is more significant in assessing cancer risk in these two categories of professionals, due to the higher Inhalation Unit Risk (IUR) of formaldehyde compared to benzene. Since the origin of the danger to laboratory technicians is clear (use of chemicals necessary for the experiments), in policemen the presence of carbonyls in indoor air concentrations due to smoking or used materials constitute a danger equal to the exposure to traffic originated air pollutants.

Title:  behavioral models; rainwater tanks; resolution timescale; storm water retention; water saving        
Abstract: The main objective of the paper is to identify the appropriate temporal scale for modeling the behavior of rainwater harvesting tanks in relation to the purpose they are built for, i.e., water saving, stormwater retention potential, etc. A tank water balance model coupled with a specific procedure to determine long-term series of rainfall (tank inflow) and toilet flushes (tank outflow) at different daily and sub-daily resolution timescales was developed. The model was applied to a household case study for which detailed water demand data are available from measurements. Simulations show that the daily scale may be reliably chosen to evaluate the tank water saving efficiency. In contrast, sub-daily resolutions (at least the hourly time step) are needed for the evaluation of the tank retention efficiency to limit inaccuracies, especially for small tanks and for high values of the water demand. Moreover, preliminary results at the 5 min time step show that rainwater tanks can help in reducing the rainfall intensity peak, basically depending on the tank storage and on the rainfall event characteristics.

Title:  ADHD; caregivers; caregivers groups and sessions; therapeutic conversation intervention        
Abstract: Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Caregivers of adolescents with ADHD experience major difficulties as care providers and are in need of guidance and support. Adolescents with ADHD may develop oppositional and criminal behaviour. More than 50 % have the symptoms in adulthood, and up to one-fourth with severe emotional or antisocial difficulties. There is a lack of evidence of caregivers supporting intervention although caregiver groups have been found to contribute to better coping, decreased stress and improvements in ADHD symptoms. What does this paper add to existing knowledge? Primary caregivers of adolescents with ADHD experienced better quality of life after the Therapeutic Conversation Intervention. The intervention contributed to better social functioning among secondary caregivers. What are the implications for practice? The content of the Therapeutic Conversation Intervention is significant and highlights the utility of a combination of group and private sessions for caregivers of people with ADHD. The intervention can influence how services for families are organized, such that a Therapeutic Conversation Intervention could be offered on a regular basis. Abstract Introduction Caregivers of adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder are burdened with tasks and many suffer from distress. Adolescents with ADHD may develop antisocial behaviour and caregivers group can empower caregiver's supporting role. Aim/Question To evaluate the effectiveness of a Therapeutic Conversation Intervention on caregivers of adolescents with ADHD regarding strengthening the supportive role. Method The study utilized a quasi-experimental design. The participants (n=60) were caregivers of adolescents (13-17years old) with ADHD. The intervention consisted in-group and parent sessions. The Calgary Family Model and the Family Illness Beliefs Model were used as theoretical frameworks. Results The study revealed significant differences in the improvement of quality of life; regarding primary caregiver (PC) worry, daily activities, family relationships and collaboration post-intervention, as well emotional functioning at both post-intervention and follow-up. Secondary caregiver (SC) social functioning was significantly improved at follow-up. Discussion The intervention proved to be beneficial to the caregivers and is filling a gap in much needed intervention. Implication for practice The results will expand health care professionals' knowledge of how to increase PC quality of life when supporting their adolescent with ADHD. This treatment information should improve service at health care centres/hospitals where adolescents with ADHD receive care.

Title:  knee arthoscopy; osteoarthritis; meniscus tears        
Abstract: Background: In 2002, Moseley et al published a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that showed no difference between knee arthroscopy and placebo for patients with osteoarthritis (OA). We wanted to assess the impact of the trial on clinical practice in the United States. Purpose/Hypothesis:To evaluate changes in knee arthroscopy practice before and after publication of the article by Moseley et al and to assess the effect of this landmark RCT on the behavior of practicing orthopaedic surgeons. We hypothesized that after publication of the Moseley trial, the overall frequency of knee arthroscopy would decrease, that the mean age of patients undergoing knee arthroscopy would decrease, and that the proportion of arthroscopies for a diagnosis of OA would decrease. Study Design:Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods:The State Ambulatory Surgery Database was used to analyze cases from 1998 to 2006, which were classified as meniscus tear, OA, or OA with meniscus tear. Changes in age, surgery rates, and case classification were evaluated before and after Moseley's trial using Student t tests and analysis of variance. Results:After publication of the trial, the number of knee arthroscopies per year increased from 155,057 in 1998 to 172,317 in 2006 (P < .001). Mean patient age increased from 47.6 to 49.2 years (P <= .001). Meniscus tears increased from 69.1% to 70.8%, representing approximately 15,500 additional cases per year. OA decreased from 10.6% to 7.2%, representing approximately 4000 fewer cases per year. OA with meniscus tear increased from 20.3% to 22.0%, representing approximately 6400 additional cases per year. Conclusion:While overall age and rates of knee arthroscopy increased contrary to our hypothesis, we identified a decrease in rates of knee arthroscopy for OA after publication of the Moseley trial, demonstrating that well-publicized RCTs can influence patterns of clinical practice.

Title:  Microring resonator modulator; Signal flow graph; Phase ring enhancement; Optimization        
Abstract: The modeling of microring resonator modulators with phase rings is presented. The phase ring effect and the bandwidth optimization are studied by using the proposed model. Results show that the phase ring can enhance the modulation effectively. It also causes modulation resonances which worsens the modulation performances. Resonators with double phase rings keep the coupling region symmetric and have good phase enhancement ability. The amplitude of the modulated signal can be increased substantially while the phase rings are optimized by setting the operating point at the resonance point.

Title:  Mexican Americans; immigrants; acculturation; drinking behavior; parenting        
Abstract: The primary goal of the current study was to test whether parent and adolescent preference for a common language moderates the association between parenting and rank-order change over time in offspring substance use. A sample of Mexican-origin 7th-grade adolescents (M-age = 12.5 years, N = 194, 52% female) was measured longitudinally on use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Mothers, fathers, and adolescents all reported on consistent discipline and monitoring of adolescents. Both consistent discipline and monitoring predicted relative decreases in substance use into early adulthood but only among parent-offspring dyads who expressed preference for the same language (either English or Spanish). This moderation held after controlling for parent substance use, family structure, having completed schooling in Mexico, years lived in the United States, family income, and cultural values. An unintended consequence of the immigration process may be the loss of parenting effectiveness that is normally present when parents and adolescents prefer to communicate in a common language.

Title:  Mediterranean Sea; Levantine basin; Remote sensing; MODIS; Phytoplankton bloom; Chlorophyll-alpha        
Abstract: The Levantine basin in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is subject to spatial and seasonal variations in primary production and physical-chemical properties both on a short and long-term basis. In this study, the monthly means of daily MODIS product images were averaged between 2002 and 2015, and used to characterize the phytoplankton blooms in different bioregions of the Levantine basin. The selected products were the sea surface temperature (SST), the chlorophyll-alpha concentration (Chl-alpha), the diffuse attenuation coefficient for down welling irradiance at 490 nm (Kd_490) and the colored dissolved organic matter index (CDO-M_index). Our results showed that phytoplankton blooms were spatially and temporally variable. They occurred in late autumn at the Nile Delta, in early spring and late summer at the eastern coastline, and in spring at the northeastern coastline. The northern coastline and the open water had a common bloom occurring in winter. The Nile Delta was found to be the most productive area of the Levantine basin showing high Chl-alpha. Kd_490 and Chl-alpha present a parallel co-variation indicating a dominance of Case 1 waters in the Levantine basin. The CDOM_index shows a phase shift with the Chl-alpha fluctuation. A strong inverse correlation was observed between both Chl-alpha and CDOM_index with SST, connoting an indirect relation represented by a depression of CDOM in summer by photobleaching, and a suppression of the chlorophyll-alpha concentration due to water stratification, together with nutrient stress. An overestimation of the Chl-alpha values had been signaled by the use of the CDOM_index, suggesting a correction plan in a latter study.

Only a minority of these subjects (about 10-25%) experience symptoms, fulfilling Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis (IBS-like symptoms) in 10% to 66% of cases. Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) is a syndrome characterized by recurrent abdominal symptoms attributed to diverticula in the absence of macroscopically evident alterations other than the presence of diverticula. Due to the different peak of incidence, the overlap between SUDD and IBS is predominantly present in middle-aged or older patients. In these cases, it is very complex to establish if the symptoms are related to the presence of diverticula or due to an overlapping IBS. In fact, the link between gastrointestinal symptoms and diverticula is unclear, and the mechanism by which diverticula may induce the development of IBS-like symptoms remains to be elucidated. Currently, the etiology and pathophysiology of SUDD, particularly when IBS-like symptoms are present, are not completely understood, and thus these two entities remain a diagnostic challenge not only for the general practitioner but also for the gastroenterologist. Although many issues remain open and unresolved, some minimize the importance of a distinction of these two entities as dietary and pharmacological management may be largely overlapping.

Title:  Leakage current; pulse width modulation; three-phase four-leg inverter; transformerless photovoltaic system        
Abstract: Eliminating the leakage current is one of the most important issues for transformerless three-phase photovoltaic (PV) systems. In this paper, the leakage current elimination of a three-phase four-leg PV inverter is investigated. With the common-mode loop model established, the generation mechanism of the leakage current is clearly identified. Different typical carrier-based modulation methods and their corresponding common-mode voltages are discussed. A new modulation strategy with Boolean logic function is proposed to achieve the constant common-mode voltage for the leakage current reduction. Finally, the different modulation methods are implemented and tested on the TMS320F28335 DSP +XC3S400 FPGA digital control platform. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Title:  Depression; Tryptophan; Pyridoxal phosphate; Serotonin; Melatonin; Sleep; Obesity; Hypertension; Seizures; Parkinson's disease        
Abstract: Depression is characterized by sadness, purposelessness, irritability, and impaired body functions. Depression causes severe symptoms for several weeks, and dysthymia, which may cause chronic, low-grade symptoms. Treatment of depression involves psychotherapy, medications, or phototherapy. Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that an appropriate diet can reduce symptoms of depression. The neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT), synthesized in the brain, plays an important role in mood alleviation, satiety, and sleep regulation. Although certain fruits and vegetables are rich in 5-HT, it is not easily accessible to the CNS due to blood brain barrier. However the serotonin precursor, tryptophan, can readily pass through the blood brain barrier. Tryptophan is converted to 5-HT by tryptophan hydroxylase and 5-HTP decarboxylase, respectively, in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate, derived from vitamin B-6. Hence diets poor in tryptophan may induce depression as this essential amino acid is not naturally abundant even in protein-rich foods. Tryptophan-rich diet is important in patients susceptible to depression such as certain females during pre and postmenstrual phase, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Carbohydrate-rich diet triggers insulin response to enhance the bioavailability of tryptophan in the CNS which is responsible for increased craving of carbohydrate diets. Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed to obese patients with depressive symptoms, these agents are incapable of precisely regulating the CNS serotonin and may cause life-threatening adverse effects in the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. However, CNS serotonin synthesis can be controlled by proper intake of tryptophan-rich diet. This report highlights the clinical significance of tryptophan-rich diet and vitamin B6 to boost serotonergic neurotransmission in depression observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. However pharmacological interventions to modulate serotonergic neurotransmission in depression, remains clinically significant. Depression may involve several other molecular mechanisms as discussed briefly in this report. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  Morality; Honesty; Synchrony; Social perception; Nonverbal behavior        
Abstract: Emerging evidence revealed that honesty and trustworthiness are important drivers of the impression-formation process. Questions remain, however, regarding the role of these moral attributes in guiding real and concrete behaviors. Filling this gap, the present study investigated the influence of honesty on a nonverbal behavior that regulates social interactions: behavioral synchrony. Movements were recorded while participants interacted with a partner who was depicted as honest (versus dishonest) or as friendly (versus unfriendly). Results showed that synchrony was affected only by the honesty of the partner. Specifically, the more the interaction partner lacked honesty, the lower the perceived similarity between the self and the interaction partner, which in turn diminished the promptness to engage in behavioral synchrony. Our findings connected the literature on behavioral synchrony with that on the implication of morality for social perception, revealing the key role of the honesty facet of moral character in shaping nonverbal behaviors.

Title:  Pair-programming; Extreme Progranuning; Agile; Computing Education; Teaching/Learning Methodologies        
Abstract: In pair-programming, two developers share a computer to work together on developing one piece of code. To test Pair-programming effects on student performance in a Middle Eastern society where some interaction restrictions are found, we devised an experiment that was carried out over an entire academic year consists of two semesters. The experiment targeted two sections per semester of an advanced computer programming course. The students of one of the sections worked in pairs during the lab sessions, applying pair-programming rules and techniques. The other section had students who worked individually, as it is the norm in most programming labs. Through this experiment we revealed that pair-programming has the potential to increase the students' confidence, their enjoyment of the course, and improved the course's completion rate. In addition, the students in the pair-programming section showed that they were able to individually produce code of better quality than the students in the traditional section.

Title:  intraocular pressure; glaucoma; stress; adherence; anxiety; depression        
Abstract: Background: Asymptomatic in its early stages, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. While psychosocial factors are taken into consideration for a host of diseases such as cancer, heart disease and autoimmune conditions, to date, psychological issues have been ignored in the clinical management of glaucoma. Objective: This work reviews the most relevant contributions from a health psychology perspective for the assessment and treatment of glaucoma, which is emerging in the field of psycho-ophthalmology. Method: To provide scientific evidence regarding contributions of psychology to the comprehension of glaucoma, a bibliographic review of three databases (Psicodoc, PsycInfo and Medline) was conducted, spanning the period between 1940 and 2016. Results: This review yielded a total of 66 studies published in the period analysed and identified three areas where health psychology has made substantive contributions to glaucoma screening, monitoring and treatment: the emotional impact on patients suffering from glaucoma, the adherence to treatment and the effects of stress on intraocular pressure. Conclusions: A health psychology approach for research and therapy of glaucoma must focus on the management of the negative affect associated with the diagnosis, the optimisation of treatment adherence and the stress management of the intraocular pressure measurements.

Title:  Carbon; Stormwater; BMPs; SCMs; Carbon sequestration; Carbon footprint; Carbon emissions; Stormwater wetlands; Bioretention; Swales        
Abstract: Due to increased regulations concerning urban stormwater runoff, stormwater control measures (SCMs) such as bioretention, ponds, and constructed stormwater wetlands, are becoming a more common feature of urban and periurban landscapes. The water quality and hydrologic benefits of SCMs are generally well-documented, and planning tools are available to optimize water quality benefits with economic costs of SCM construction and maintenance. Given rising interest in and potential for regulation of carbon emissions, a planning tool that allows for estimation of carbon emissions associated with SCM construction and maintenance is also a relevant pursuit. The objective of this work was to present a framework by which carbon emissions attributable to SCMs and conveyances could be predicted. This method was then applied to present a comparison of the carbon footprint of eight common SCMs and three stormwater conveyance types. The carbon embodied in construction materials represented a prominent part of the carbon footprint for green roofs, permeable pavement, sand filters, rainwater harvesting systems, and reinforced concrete pipes while material transport and construction dominated that of bioretention systems, ponds, wetlands, level spreader-grassed filter strips and concrete-lined swales. Despite accounting for sequestration by vegetation in these systems, only stormwater wetlands and grassed swales were predicted to store more carbon than what was released through construction and maintenance.

Title:  Concrete; Crumb rubber; Recycled coarse aggregate (RCA); Steel fibre; Compression; Flexure        
Abstract: Using recycled concrete and crumb rubber as aggregates to produce green concrete is a promising technology toward sustainability in the construction industry. In this study, the compressive and flexural behaviours of a new type of concrete material, rubber crumb and steel-fibre-reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (RSRAC), are investigated. To popularise the application of this new type of green building material, an experimental study was conducted to investigate the effect of the rubber content on the compressive and flexural behaviours of RSRAC. A total of 18 cubes (150 mm) and 18 cylinders (150 mm x 200 mm) were tested under axial compressive loading, and 18 prisms of 150 x 150 x 550 mm were tested subjected to three-point bending. The crumb rubber content was varied in the investigation at levels of 0%, 4%, 8%, 12% and 16% by volume substitution of sand. Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) was introduced into the concrete mixture by 100% volume substitution of natural coarse aggregate (NCA), and 1% volumetric quantity of steel fibre was added to the concrete mixture. The effect of the rubber content on the compressive and flexural strength, failure mode, modulus of elasticity and toughness of RSRAC was analysed. The results indicate that RSRAC with an optimal rubber content displays good compressive behaviour compared with normal NCA concrete. RSRAC is also a more environmentally friendly alternative to normal rubber concrete for use in the flexural members of concrete structures. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  Frequency selective surfaces(FSS); radar cross section (RCS); stealth applications        
Abstract: This paper presents the design, simulation and fabrication of a frequency selective surface (FSS) based unit cell structure over a flexible polyimide film for the effective electromagnetic absorption. The proposed FSS structure is designed using the splitted rings, where the unit cell dimensions are selected for effective EM absorption in the X band. The simulated results show absorption of 99.25% at 11.20 GHz having film thickness of 135 mu m. The proposed absorber film is effectively being used for the radar cross section (RCS) reduction of a cubical object. The proposed structure is fabricated and tested for the electromagnetic absorption as well as for the RCS reduction. A close match between the simulated and the experimental results is observed. The proposed FSS structure is ultrathin, flexible and flame retardant, which makes it a good potential candidate for the RF stealth technology.

Title:  nursing staff; organizational well-being; occupational stress management; workplace interventions; arts activity; silk painting; mental health and well-being; arts for health        
Abstract: Over 59 million workers are employed in the healthcare sector globally, with a daily risk of being exposed to a complex variety of health and safety hazards. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of arts activity on the well-being of nursing staff. During October-December 2014, 115 nursing staff working in a hospital, took part in this study, which lasted for 10 weeks. The intervention group (n = 56) took part in silk painting activities once a week. Data was collected using socio-demographic questions, the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, Short Form36 Health Survey questionnaire, Reeder stress scale, and Multidimensional fatigue inventory (before and after art activities in both groups). Statistical data analysis included descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation), non-parametric statistics analysis (Man Whitney U Test; Wilcoxon signedranks test), Fisher's exact test and reliability analysis (Cronbach's Alpha). The level of significance was set at p <= 0.05. In the intervention group, there was a tendency for participation in arts activity having a positive impact on their general health and mental well-being, reducing stress and fatigue, awaking creativity and increasing a sense of community at work. The control group did not show any improvements. Of the intervention group 93% reported enjoyment, with 75% aspiring to continue arts activity in the future. This research suggests that arts activity, as a workplace intervention, can be used to promote nursing staff well-being at work.

Title:  Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance; Microbiota; Heterarchy        
Abstract: This review paper discusses the perspective of complex biological systems as applied to inheritance and ontogeny, focusing on the continuity of genetic, epigenetic (transgenerational) and microbiotic inheritance. The informational processuality within this continuity can be used as to exemplify the insufficiency of hierarchical concepts in grasping the complex and integrated nature of biological processes. The argument follows Bruni and Giorgi (Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology 119, 481-92, 2015) in emphasizing that while structures and substrates are organized hierarchically, communicational processes are organized heterarchically. The essay also argues the insufficiency of a single, basic, i.e. genetic level of description, which is the prevalent idea of twentieth century biology, to explain all phenotypic variation. I argue that inheritance and development cannot be fully explained by some sub- or super-ordination and that such descriptions are merely heuristic tools that do not reflect the nature of such processes.

Title:  smart material; shrinking microfiber; heat activated microfibers; pH activated microfibers; fiber reinforcement; fiber reinforced concrete; polymeric composite structures        
Abstract: This paper describes an innovative fiber reinforcement technology for cementitious composite structures that employs in situ shrinking microfibers to provide supplemental strength-enhancing compressive stresses. Reinforced concrete is one of the most commonly used structural materials in construction industry, primarily due to its cost, durability, ability to be easily fabricated into a variety of shapes on site, and locally abundant raw material availability almost everywhere. Unlike incumbent passive reinforcing microfiber technology, in situ shrinking microfibers that respond to an in situ stimulus such as heat, pH, or moisture variations can induce precompression to matrix and create additional resistance from external loads, creating stronger composite structures. In this paper, heat-activated-shrinking (HAS) microfibers made from polyolefin, and pH-activated-shrinking (pHAS) microfibers made from chitosan powder were used to study effects of shrinking microfiber reinforcing in concrete. Shrinking ratios and tensile strengths of both microfibers were measured. Cementitious specimens with active shrinking microfibers, passive non shrinking fibers, as well as control samples were made. Mechanical properties of the samples were compared with compression and three-point bending tests. The optimum microfiber weight percentages for HAS microfibers were 0.5 wt% in compression tests, and 1.0 wt% in three-point bending tests. For pHAS microfibers, the optimum weight percentages were 0.5 wt% in three-point bending tests. Compared to heat passive microfibers specimens, 45% increase in the maximum compression strengths, and 124% increase in the maximum bending strengths were achieved at the optimum weight percentages of HAS microfibers. In addition, with 0.5 wt% of pHAS microfibers, 145% increase in the maximum bending strengths of three-point bending tests resulted compared to pH passive microfibers specimens.

Abstract: Research aims to improve health outcomes for patients. However, the setting of research priorities is usually performed by clinicians, academics, and funders, with little involvement of patients or caregivers and using processes that lack transparency. A national workshop was convened in Australia to generate and prioritize research questions in chronic kidney disease (CKD) among diverse stakeholder groups. Patients with CKD (n = 23), nephrologists/surgeons (n = 16), nurses (n = 8), caregivers (n = 7), and allied health professionals and researchers (n = 4) generated and voted on intervention questions across 4 treatment categories: CKD stages 1 to 5 (non-dialysis dependent), peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and kidney transplantation. The 5 highest ranking questions (in descending order) were as follows: How effective are lifestyle programs for preventing deteriorating kidney function in early CKD? What strategies will improve family consent for deceased donor kidney donation, taking different cultural groups into account? What interventions can improve long-term post-transplant outcomes? What are effective interventions for post hemodialysis fatigue? How can we improve and individualize drug therapy to control post-transplant side effects? Priority questions were focused on prevention, lifestyle, quality of life, and long-term impact. These prioritized research questions can inform funding agencies, patient/consumer organizations, policy makers, and researchers in developing a CKD research agenda that is relevant to key stakeholders.

Title:  big data; internet of things; geo-distributed computing; deep learning; cloud computing        
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for a deep learning system, named k-degree layer-wise network, to realize efficient geo-distributed computing between Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT). The geo-distributed computing extends Cloud to the geographical verge of the network in the neighbor of IoT. The basic ideas of the proposal include a k-degree constraint and a layer-wise constraint. The k-degree constraint is defined such that the degree of each vertex on the h-th layer is exactly k(h) to extend the existing deep belief networks and control the communication cost. The layer-wise constraint is defined such that the layer-wise degrees are monotonically decreasing in positive direction to gradually reduce the dimension of data. We prove the k-degree layer-wise network is sparse, while a typical deep neural network is dense. In an evaluation on the M-distributed MNIST database, the proposal is superior to a state-of-the-art model in terms of communication cost and learning time with scalability.

Title:  Information and communication sector; stochastic frontier; translog production function; Malmquist productivity index        
Abstract: The paper deals with production performance evaluation and comparison among the EU selected countries in information and communication sectors in the period 2005 - 2012. We estimate a translog stochastic production frontier using Corrected Ordinary Least Squares (COLS) method in the total Information and communication sector (J) and also its two parts - Telecommunications (J61) and Computer programming, consultancy and information service activities (J62-63). We also compare the distribution of the Malmquist productivity index and its decomposition into technical and technological changes. The results confirmed that the translog production function is preferred over a Cobb-Douglas functional form with neutral technical progress. Estimated technical efficiency was the highest in the whole sector J and slightly lower is in subsector J61. Development of the Malmquist productivity index in the sector of Information and communication services exhibits a declining trend from 2006 to 2008, followed by a moderate rise till the year 2010 and another slight declining. Based on the decomposition of the Malmquist Index, we observed that technology efficiency change seems to have a rather small effect on the productivity growth.

Abstract: Hundreds of papers on job scheduling for distributed systems are published every year and it becomes increasingly difficult to classify them. Our analysis revealed that half of these papers are barely cited. This paper presents a general taxonomy for scheduling problems and solutions in distributed systems. This taxonomy was used to classify and make publicly available the classification of 109 scheduling problems and their solutions. These 109 problems were further clustered into ten groups based on the features of the taxonomy. The proposed taxonomy will facilitate researchers to build on prior art, increase new research visibility, and minimize redundant effort.

Title:  Torsional vibration transmissibility; Magnetorheological elastomer (MRE); Smart material; Dynamic tuning        
Abstract: Mechanical systems with rotary machines or rotating elements experience torsional vibration, which may lead to an extreme damage and wear. Conventionally, to isolate these undesirable structural vibrations, passive elastomer or torsional dampers are used. However, these passive vibration isolators are not adaptive to varying oscillation frequencies in real time. Due to the need for a real time adaptability and controllable stiffness, the research and development of a smart material called magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) is of interest. This paper presents the mathematical modelling and development of MRE with its implication in torsional vibration control. Based on the model and through experimental studies, the properties of the MRE such as stiffness and transmissibility factor in regard to varying magnetic fields are investigated. The change in magnetic field is achieved by changing the amount of applied current. It is found out that the stiffness of MRE increases with increasing magnetic field and consequently modifies system's natural frequency. This allows shift in the transmissibility curve to achieve minimum transmissibility factor in the applications involving varying frequency.

Title:  Anorexia nervosa; Recovered; Adolescents; Neurocognition; Verbal memory; Social function        
Abstract: Background: Young individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) or recovered from AN display impairments of social function. To date, however, it is not clear whether they differ from controls with respect to neurocognitive performance and whether those functions contribute to the compromised social function observed in individuals with AN. Methods: We included 43 young females with first-episode AN, 28 individuals recovered from adolescent-onset AN, and 41 control individuals (14-22 yr), all without comorbid autism spectrum disorder. We compared the performance of participants across groups in seven neurocognitive functions relevant to social functioning: set-shifting, local processing, processing speed, working memory, sustained attention, verbal memory, and verbal abstraction. Further, we tested the association between neurocognitive function and social function, measured by Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), with an ordinal logistic regression model. Results: First, participants did not differ on any neurocognitive function across groups. Second, only the neurocognitive function ""verbal memory"" was significantly associated with social function. Higher performance in verbal memory was associated with lower odds of impaired social function. Diagnostic group remained a significant factor, but the absence of an interaction between group and neurocognitive performance indicated that the association between verbal memory and social function was independent of group membership. Conclusion: Young individuals with AN and those recovered from AN did not differ from controls with respect to neurocognitive performance. Verbal memory was associated with social function in all groups.

Title:  Cytochrome oxidase I (COI); European abalone; Haplotypes; Microsatellites; Phylogeography; Population structure; Sperm lysin gene        
Abstract: The genetic differentiation among the populations of the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata was investigated using different markers to better understand the evolutionary history and exchanges between populations. Three markers were used: mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI), the sperm lysin nuclear gene, and eight nuclear microsatellites. These markers present different characteristics concerning mutation rate and inheritance, which provided complementary information about abalone history and gene diversity. Genetic diversity and relationships among subspecies were calculated from a sample of approximately 500 individuals, collected from 17 different locations in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, Macaronesia, and Mediterranean Sea. COI marker was used to explore the phylogeny of the species with a network analysis and two phylogenetic methods. The analysis revealed 18 major haplotypes grouped into two distinct clades with a pairwise sequence divergence up to 3.5 %. These clades do not correspond to subspecies but revealed many contacts along Atlantic coast during the Pleistocene interglaciations. The sperm lysin gene analysis separated two different subtaxa: one associated to Macaronesian islands, and the other to all other populations. Moreover, a small population of the northern subtaxon was isolated in the Adriatic Seaprobably before the separation of the two lineages-and evolved independently. Microsatellites were analyzed by different genetics methods, including the Bayesian clustering method and migration patterns analysis. It revealed genetically distinct microsatellite patterns among populations from Mediterranean Sea, Brittany and Normandy, Morocco, and Canary and Balearic islands. Gene flow is asymmetric among the regions; the Azores and the Canary Islands are particularly isolated and have low effective population sizes. Our results support the hypothesis that climate changes since the Pleistocene glaciations have played a major role in the geographic distribution of the European abalone. Traces of these events related to maternal inheritance were shown on COI marker.

Title:  Lupus; Genomics; Therapeutics; Immunology        
Abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with complex genetic underpinnings. This review attempts to assemble the myriad of genomic findings to build a clearer picture of the pathobiology of SLE to serve as a guide for therapeutics. Over 100 genes are now known for SLE, and several more penetrant ones have led to the emergence of more defined lupus phenotypes. Also discussed here are the targeted therapies that have come up on the horizon and the specific biologic mechanisms of more traditional therapies which have only recently been explored. The diagnostic toolbox has been enhanced by the addition of new antibodies, gene expression signatures, and mutation panels. This provides an opportunity to piece together the lupus puzzle and even revisit the clinical classification of SLE.

Title:  Pea fiber; Methanogen; Diversity; Colon; Pig        
Abstract: Background: Pea fiber (PF) is a potential fibrous supplement in swine production. The influence of dietary PF on microbial community in the colon of pigs remains largely unexplored. Methanogens in the hindgut of monogastric animals play important roles in degradation of dietary fibers and efficient removal of microbial metabolic end product H-2. Understanding the impact of dietary PF on the structure of colonic methanogens may help understand the mechanisms of microbe-mediated physiological functions of PF. This study investigated the influence of PF on the diversity and quantity and/or activity of colonic methanongens of piglets and finishing pigs. Four archaeal 16S rRNA clone libraries were constructed for piglets and finishers fed with control (Piglet-C and Finisher-C) or PF diet (Piglet-P and Finisher-P). Results: There were 195, 190, 194 and 196 clones obtained from the library Piglet-C, Piglet-P, Finisher-C and Finisher-P, respectively, with corresponding 12, 11, 11 and 16 OTUs (operational taxonomic units). Significant differences of Shannon Index among the four libraries were found (P < 0.05). Libshuff analysis showed that the archaeal community structure among the four libraries were significantly different (P < 0.0001). The predominant methanogens shifted from Methanobrevibacter to Methanobrevibacter and Methanomassiliicoccus-like genus as a result of dietary PF. Supplementation of PF significantly increased the copy numbers of mcrA and dsrA genes (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Alteration of methanogenic community structure may lead to functional transition from utilization of H-2/CO2 to employment of both H-2/CO2 and methanol/CO2. Quantification of three functional genes (mcrA, dsrA and fhs) of methanogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and acetogens revealed that dietary PF also increased the activity of methanogens and SRB, probably associated with increased proportion of Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis-species. Further study is required to examine the interaction between specific methanogens and SRB during fermentation of dietary PF.

Title:  ABCA4; retinal dystrophy; meta-analysis; genotype-phenotype correlation; in silico prediction; mild variants        
Abstract: Variants in the ABCA4 gene are associated with a spectrum of inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), most prominently with autosomal recessive (ar) Stargardt disease (STGD1) and ar cone-rod dystrophy. The clinical outcome to a large degree depends on the severity of the variants. To provide an accurate prognosis and to select patients for novel treatments, functional significance assessment of nontruncating ABCA4 variants is important. We collected all published ABCA4 variants from 3,928 retinal dystrophy cases in a Leiden Open Variation Database, and compared their frequency in 3,270 Caucasian IRD cases with 33,370 non-Finnish European control individuals. Next to the presence of 270 protein-truncating variants, 191 nontruncating variants were significantly enriched in the patient cohort. Furthermore, 30 variants were deemed benign. Assessing the homozygous occurrence of frequent variants in IRD cases based on the allele frequencies in control individuals confirmed the mild nature of the p.[Gly863Ala, Gly863del] variant and identified three additional mild variants (p.(Ala1038Val), c.5714+5G>A, and p.(Arg2030Gln)). The p.(Gly1961Glu) variant was predicted to act as a mild variant in most cases. Based on these data, in silico analyses, and American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, we provide pathogenicity classifications on a five-tier scale from benign to pathogenic for all variants in the ABCA4-LOVD database.

Title:  Health insurance; Children; Utilization; Electronic health records; Medicaid; CHIP        
Abstract: Objective The future of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is uncertain after 2017. Survey-based research shows positive associations between CHIP expansions and children's healthcare utilization. To build on this prior work, we used electronic health record (EHR) data to assess temporal patterns of healthcare utilization after Oregon's 2009-2010 CHIP expansion. We hypothesized increased post-expansion utilization among children who gained public insurance. Methods Using EHR data from 154 Oregon community health centers, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients (2-18 years old) who gained public insurance coverage during the Oregon expansion (n = 3054), compared to those who were continuously publicly insured (n = 10,946) or continuously uninsured (n = 10,307) during the 2-year study period. We compared pre-post rates of primary care visits, well-child visits, and dental visits within- and between-groups. We also conducted longitudinal analysis of monthly visit rates, comparing the three insurance groups. Results After Oregon's 2009-2010 CHIP expansions, newly insured patients' utilization rates were more than double their pre-expansion rates [adjusted rate ratios (95 % confidence intervals); increases ranged from 2.10 (1.94-2.26) for primary care visits to 2.77 (2.56-2.99) for dental visits]. Utilization among the newly insured spiked shortly after coverage began, then leveled off, but remained higher than the uninsured group. Conclusions This study used EHR data to confirm that CHIP expansions are associated with increased utilization of essential pediatric primary and preventive care. These findings are timely to pending policy decisions that could impact children's access to public health insurance in the United States.

Abstract: Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a heart failure syndrome occurring late in pregnancy or during the early post-natal period. The pathophysiology of peripartum cardiomyopathy is not fully understood and various mechanisms have been postulated including an underlying inflammatory process. We here report four cases presenting with acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three out of four of the patients presented with a left ventricular ejection fraction <30% and one with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. All made a full clinical recovery following treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids. This case series adds to the growing body of evidence for the role for immunosuppressants in the management of peripartum cardiomyopathy.

Title:  Osteoid osteoma of the talus; Computed tomography; Ankle arthritis; Ankle instability; Case report        
Abstract: Background: Osteoid osteoma (OO) is a common benign bone tumour that is rarely found in the talus. Its nidus is difficult to detect on early imaging. The atypical symptoms of OO and the presence of concurrent trauma or sports injuries may lead to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. We herein analyse a case of misdiagnosis of OO of the talus and discuss how to improve the early diagnosis of this rare lesion, thereby permitting rapid treatment. Case presentation: A 23-year-old man with a history of left ankle sprains and chronic pain was diagnosed with another ankle sprain and managed conservatively based on normal X-ray findings. After 1 year of recurring pain, he was diagnosed with ankle traumatic arthritis and underwent arthroscopic surgery. His preoperative ankle X-ray findings were still normal, and magnetic resonance imaging at that time demonstrated bone marrow oedema of the left talus. His symptoms reappeared shortly after surgery and progressively worsened. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 3 months after surgery demonstrated widespread bone marrow oedema of the talus. The patient presented to our hospital for pain assessment and was diagnosed with OO of the talus 3 years after his symptoms began. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a typical nidus of OO of the talus. After a second surgery, the patient's symptoms completely resolved, and pathologic examination confirmed that the lesion was OO. The patient recovered 3 months later and was able to walk normally. Conclusions: OO of the ankle joint exhibits a progressive course and is difficult to diagnose at an early stage. Patients with OO of the talus often have atypical imaging findings, no signs of ankle instability, and no anterior talofibular ligament tenderness. CT is valuable for diagnosing OO, although multiple CT scans may be required to detect the nidus. Proper imaging helps doctors to achieve the correct diagnosis early in the disease course, significantly shortening the treatment cycle and improving the patient's quality of life.

Abstract: Objective: To understand effective ways for EMS providers to interact with distressed family members during a field intervention involving a recent or impending out-of-hospital ( OOH) pediatric death. Methods: Eight focus groups with 98 EMS providers were conducted in urban and rural settings between November 2013 and March 2014. Sixty-eight providers also completed a short questionnaire about a specific event including demographics. Seventy-eight percent of providers were males, 13% were either African American or Hispanic, and the average number of years in EMS was 16 years. They were asked how team members managed the family during the response to a dying child, what was most helpful for families whose child suddenly and unexpectedly was dead in the OOH setting, and what follow up efforts with the family were effective. Results: The professional response by the EMS team was critical to family coping and getting necessary support. There were several critical competencies identified to help the family cope including: ( 1) that EMS provide excellent and expeditious care with seamless coordination, ( 2) allowing family to witness the resuscitation including the attempts to save the child's life, and ( 3) providing ongoing communication. Whether the child is removed from the scene or not, keeping the family appraised of what is happening and why is critical. Exclusion of families from the process in cases of suspected child abuse is not warranted. Giving tangible forms of support by calling friends, family, and clergy, along with allowing the family time with the child after death, giving emotional support, and follow-up gestures all help families cope. Conclusion: The study revealed effective ways for EMS providers to interact with distressed family members during an OOH pediatric death

Title:  network robot systems; human-robot interaction; ambient intelligence; cloud robotics; ubiquitous computing        
Abstract: We have developed a ""network robot system"" framework with the objective of enabling practical deployment of social robots to provide real-world services in everyday social environments. This framework addresses practical issues in social human-robot interaction by integrating ambient intelligence systems, networked data stores, human supervisors, and centralized planning. All of the elements of the system have been developed and tested in public and commercial spaces such as shopping malls, resulting in a flexible robot control architecture based on practical, real-world requirements. We describe several elements of the system and demonstrate examples of its use in five years of real-world field deployments and research. Finally, we present the Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform (UNR-PF), an internationally-standardized high-level architecture for service robots based on our framework.

Title:  Dental implants; Zirconia; Osseointegration; Ceramics; Polyether ketone; Elastic modudus        
Abstract: Background: One of the disadvantages of the zirconia implants is the lack of elasticity, which is increased with the use of ceramic or zirconia crowns. The consequences that could result from this lack of elasticity have led to the search for new materials with improved mechanical properties. Case presentation: A patient who is a 45-year-old woman, non-smoker and has no medical record of interest with a longitudinal fracture in the palatal root of molar tooth 1.7 and absence of tooth 1.6 was selected in order to receive a zirconia implant with a PEEK-based restoration and a composite coating. The following case report describes and analyses treatment with zirconia implants in molars following a flapless surgical technique. Zirconia implants are an alternative to titanium implants in patients with allergies or who are sensitive to metal alloys. However, one of the disadvantages that they have is their lack of elasticity, which increases with the use of ceramic or zirconia crowns. The consequences that can arise from this lack of elasticity have led to the search for new materials with better mechanical properties to cushion occlusal loads. PEEK-based restoration in implant prosthetics can compensate these occlusal forces, facilitating cushioning while chewing. Conclusion: This procedure provides excellent elasticity and resembles natural tooth structure. This clinical case suggests that PEEK restorations can be used in zirconia implants in dentistry.

Title:  game theory; coevolution; modelling; cancer population dynamics; therapeutic scheduling        
Abstract: Failure to understand evolutionary dynamics has been hypothesized as limiting our ability to control biological systems. An increasing awareness of similarities between macroscopic ecosystems and cellular tissues has inspired optimism that game theory will provide insights into the progression and control of cancer. To realize this potential, the ability to compare game theoretic models and experimental measurements of population dynamics should be broadly disseminated. In this tutorial, we present an analysis method that can be used to train parameters in game theoretic dynamics equations, used to validate the resulting equations, and used to make predictions to challenge these equations and to design treatment strategies. The data analysis techniques in this tutorial are adapted from the analysis of reaction kinetics using the method of initial rates taught in undergraduate general chemistry courses. Reliance on computer programming is avoided to encourage the adoption of these methods as routine bench activities.

The method is based on Harmonic Linearisation and Linear Time Periodic (LTP) analysis techniques and a single-phase grid-feeding inverter with PLL is considered as case study. Although stability analysis has been developed using the average model of the converter, the obtained results can be extended to the switching model and it is possible to evaluate precisely the boundary between stability and instability.

Title:  beta-keratins; epidermis; mRNAs; protein evolution; turtle        
Abstract: This study presents, for the first time, sequences of five beta-keratin cDNAs from turtle epidermis obtained by means of 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analyses. The deduced amino acid sequences correspond to distinct glycine-proline-serine-tyrosine rich proteins containing 122-174 amino acids. In situ hybridization shows that beta-keratin mRNAs are expressed in cells of the differentiating beta-layers of the shell scutes. Southern blotting analysis reveals that turtle beta-keratins belong to a well-conserved multigene family. This result was confirmed by the amplification and sequencing of 13 genomic fragments corresponding to beta-keratin genes. Like snake, crocodile and avian beta-keratin genes, turtle beta-keratins contain an intron that interrupts the 5'-untranslated region. The length of the intron is variable, ranging from 0.35 to 1.00 kb. One of the sequences obtained from genomic amplifications corresponds to one of the five sequences obtained from cDNA cloning; thus, sequences of a total of 17 turtle beta-keratins were determined in the present study. The predicted molecular weight of the 17 different deduced proteins range from 11.9 to 17.0 kDa with a predicted isoelectric point of 6.8-8.4; therefore, they are neutral to basic proteins. A central region rich in proline and with beta-strand conformation shows high conservation with other reptilian and avian beta-keratins, and it is likely involved in their polymerization. Glycine repeat regions, often containing tyrosine, are localized toward the C-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis shows that turtle beta-keratins are more similar to crocodilian and avian beta-keratins than to those of lizards and snakes.

Title:  Precision agriculture; N fertilization; Remote sensing; Winter oilseed rape; Site-specific fertilization        
Abstract: Winter oilseed rape (WOSR) is a major crop in Germany, combining economic benefits with a high value in crop rotation, but it still lacks agronomically sound concepts for site-specific nitrogen (N) fertilization. Since ecological challenges resulting from high optimal N rates and a low N harvest index are approaching on WOSR cropping systems, optimizing N fertilization becomes crucial. Recent studies showed the importance of taking autumnal N uptake into account when estimating optimal N rates for WOSR, thus autumnal N is pivotal in the algorithm that is introduced in this study. The algorithm was parameterized by using data from site-specific N fertilization trials and optimized to reduce N fertilizer amounts. Afterwards it was tested on different commercial farms in northern Germany. The autumnal N uptake was estimated using hyperspectral reflection measurements gained from tractor-mounted devices, and the data was processed to N application maps used for the N application in spring. In addition, a uniform optimal fertilization and a uniform application of average N rates calculated by the algorithm were applied to provide control treatments. Yield, N balance and economic net-revenue were evaluated for each treatment. Yields from site-specific fertilization were slightly lower (0.06 t/ha) than from uniform optimal treatment but 0.22 t/ha higher than from the uniform application of the site-specific N amount (not significant in both cases). The N balance was significantly lower when fertilizing site-specifically instead of applying uniform optimal N rate, while the net-revenues were slightly higher. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title:  COPD; thoracic wall; abdominal wall; pulmonary function; respiratory mechanics; exercise tolerance        
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Advanced air-flow limitation in patients with COPD leads to a reduction in vital capacity, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. However, its impact on chest and abdominal wall mobility is unknown. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of patients with COPD with reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility and to investigate the effect of reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. METHODS: In 51 elderly male subjects with COPD, chest and abdominal wall mobility, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, maximal inspiratory pressure (P-Imax), maximal expiratory pressure (P-Emax), and the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) were assessed. Chest and abdominal wall mobility were measured using the breathing movement scale (0-8) at the 3 regions (upper chest, lower chest, and abdomen). Reduced mobility was defined as a value lower than the lower limit of the normal scale. The unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney test, and multiple regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: The percentages of subjects with reduced mobility were 78% for the upper chest, 76% for the lower chest, and 53% for the abdomen. The subjects with reduced mobility had significantly low FVC, FEV1, and 6MWD in each region and significantly low FEV1/FVC, PImax, and PEmax in the abdominal region compared with those with nonreduced mobility. FVC and 6MWD were independently associated with the scale values in each region and with the abdominal scale value, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of subjects with COPD had reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility, which was independently associated with FVC. Even though abdominal wall mobility was relatively preserved compared with chest wall mobility, it was also independently associated with 6MWD.

Title:  third-person perceptions; perceived media influence; reinforcement        
Abstract: This research explores the idea that when making estimates of media influence on the self and others, individuals often assume reinforcement of existing attitudes rather than assume that media content necessarily creates or changes attitudes. Consequently, perceptions of favorable attitudes on an issue should result in judgments that media strengthen favorable attitudes, and perceptions of unfavorable attitudes should result in judgments that media strengthen unfavorable attitudes. Two studies were conducted: a survey concerning attitudes toward affirmative action in higher education, and an experiment concerning responses to news coverage and responses to media violence. Support for perceived media reinforcement was obtained for both news content and, to a lesser extent, for media violence. Results are discussed in terms of providing a framework for interpreting third-person perceptions.

Title:  Coir geotextiles; Fiber degradation; Structural properties; Tensile strength; Young's modulus        
Abstract: In tropical countries where rainfall rates are high, and especially in deforested areas in the Atlantic Rainforest and Cerrado in southeastern Brazil, water is the dominant driving force of erosion. The most common method used to restore degraded tropical lands is to plant nursery-raised tree seedlings, but this method is not always practical and a variety of newer reforestation techniques have become available. Biodegradable coir geotextiles combined with native seeds can be used to restore degraded forest areas. The effects of the climatic conditions during a seasonal cycle of rain and drought were evaluated on the structural and mechanical properties of coir geotextile fibers that were treated, or not, with lime. Analyses of the tensile strength of coir fibers showed that after 12 months of exposure untreated fiber had retained 23% and treated fiber 19% of their initial strength. Two principal factors were considered in evaluating the structural properties of the coir fibers after environmental exposure: (i) initial cellulose retention and its stability after lime-treatment; (ii) lignin degradation and/or its loss to the environment. The structural changes seen by thermogravimetry (TGA) and Fourier Transforms in Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses explained the changes seen in coir mechanical properties. The greater cellulose contents of fiber structures treated with lime explained their greater tensile strength and high Young's modulus measures after the first three months of exposure in local weather conditions. Considering that lime treatment improved coir fiber properties, lime applications are indicated when coir geotextiles are to be used in acidic Brazilian Cerrado soils.

Title:  cell biology; E3 ubiquitin ligase; epithelial sodium channel (ENaC); gene knockout; intestine; membrane transport; ubiquitin        
Abstract: The ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-like (Nedd4L, or Nedd4-2) binds to and regulates stability of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in salt-absorbing epithelia in the kidney, lung, and other tissues. Its role in the distal colon, which also absorbs salt and fluid and expresses ENaC, is unknown. Using a conditional knock-out approach to knock out Nedd4L in mice intestinal epithelium (Nedd4L(f/f);Vil-Cre(ERT2)) we show here that Nedd4L depletion leads to a higher steady-state short circuit current (Isc) in mouse distal colon tissue relative to controls. This higher Isc was partially reduced by the addition of apical amiloride and strongly reduced by basolateral bumetanide as well as by depletion of basolateral Cl-, suggesting that Na+/K+/2Cl(-) (NKCC1/SLC12A2) co-transporter and ENaC are targets of Nedd4L in the colon. In accordance, NKCC1 (and ENaC) protein abundance in the colon of the Nedd4L knock-out animals was increased, indicating that Nedd4L normally suppresses these proteins. However, we did not observe co-immunoprecipitation between Nedd4L and NKCC1, suggesting that Nedd4L indirectly suppresses NKCC1 expression. Low salt diet resulted in a strong increase in and (but not ) ENaC mRNA and protein expression and ENaC activity. Although salt restriction also increased NKCC1 protein and mRNA abundance, it did not lead to its elevated activity (Isc). These results identify NKCC1 as a novel target for Nedd4L-mediated down-regulation in vivo, which modulates ion and fluid transport in the distal colon together with ENaC.

Title:  Orthogonal wave tray; Downcomer-less tray; Multiphase flow; Mass transfer; Tray efficiency        
Abstract: In the present work, hydrodynamics and mass-transfer performance of vapor-liquid flow of orthogonal wave tray (OWT) column was studied. Dry pressure drop, operating range (capacity graph) and overall column efficiency of OWT column were investigated using pilot columns. A three-dimensional CFD model was developed within the two-phase Eulerian framework to have an insight into the two-phase flow and mass-transfer behavior of OWT. The simulated results were compared with experimental data and showed a good agreement. Hydrodynamic and mass-transfer behaviors were revealed with the aid of velocity profiles, streamlines, interfacial area density distribution and so on. The effects of vapor/liquid load (F-s factor) on the Murphree tray efficiency were also studied. The simulations of OWT with different waves showed that the pressure drop, clear liquid height, froth height and Murphree tray efficiency increase with the increase of slope, and OWT with middle slope tended to have more uniform foam layer. Comparison of the liquid-phase component velocity between OWT and ripple shows that OWT has better performance in froth layer distribution and stability. The mass-transfer data showed that OWT not only had almost the same ""peak efficiency"" as sieve tray, but also had higher capacity and stability, it was suitable for capacity expansion.

Title:  Complex harmonics; power distribution transformers; real-time measurement; real-time monitoring system        
Abstract: This paper presents a new automatic control system that can precisely and automatically analyze complex harmonics occurring from the power distribution transformers. The proposed system consists of pre-amplification block, digital signal processing block, and real-time monitoring block. It can be applied to a development board with a microcontroller connected to a PC to monitor harmonics in real time because it can be individually affixed to a transformer. The existing expensive harmonics measurement systems take a lot of time to analyze complex harmonics. Unlike the conventional systems, since this system is accurate and automatic in measurement, it provides very low measurement errors and very small test overhead. The proposed system showed very low measurement errors of less than 0.8% as well as fast real-time measurements of approximately 23sec. for harmonics analysis as compared to external expensive equipment measurements. We hope that this new system will provide industry with a simple and inexpensive technique to control and analyze complex harmonics occurring from the distribution transformers.

Title:  Antioxidant; Cyclopia genistoides; Cyclopia maculata; Honeybush; skin aging; transdermal delivery        
Abstract: Background: Honeybush extracts (Cyclopia spp.) can be incorporated into skin care products to treat conditions such as skin dryness and can function as an anti-oxidant. Objective: To formulate Honeybush formulations and test it for antioxidant activity, skin penetration, and skin hydrating effects. Materials and Methods: Semi-solid formulations containing either Cyclopia maculata (2%) or Cyclopia genistoides (2%) underwent accelerated stability studies. Membrane release studies, Franz cell skin diffusion and tape stripping studies were performed. Antioxidant potential was determined with the 2-thiobarbituric acid-assay and clinical efficacy studies were performed to determine the formulations' effect on skin hydration, scaliness, and smoothness after 2 weeks of treatment on the volar forearm. Results: The formulations were unstable over 3 months. Membrane release, skin diffusion studies, and tape stripping showed that both formulations had inconclusive results due to extremely low concentrations mangiferin and hesperidin present in the Franz cell receptor compartments, stratum corneum-epidermis, and epidermis-dermis layers of the skin. Honeybush extracts showed antioxidant activity with concentrations above 0.6250 mg/ml when compared to the toxin; whereas mangiferin and hesperidin did not show any antioxidant activity on their own. The semisolid formulations showed the potential to emit their own antioxidant activity. Both formulations improved skin smoothness, although they did not improve skin hydration compared to the placebos. C. maculata reduced the skin scaliness to a larger extent than the placebos and C. genistoides. Conclusion: Honeybush formulations did not penetrate the skin but did, however, show antioxidant activity and the potential to be used to improve skin scaliness and smoothness.

Title:  Restricted access material; Disposable pipette extraction; Drugs; Plasma samples; Schizophrenia        
Abstract: This work describes restricted access material (RAM) constituted of porous octadecylsilane particles with the outer surface covered with bovine serum albumin (C18-BSA) as a stationary phase to extract drugs from plasma samples by disposable pipette extraction (DPX) for further analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The C18-BSA phase simultaneously excluded macromolecules by chemical diffusion barrier (BSA network) and enrichment of the interior phase (C18) with drug traces by sorption. The hydrophilic barrier of the Cl 8-BSA allows small molecules (drugs) to permeate through the hydrophobic part (C18), while at the same time it excludes the macromolecules by chemical diffusion barrier (BSA network). Optimization of the DPX variables (sorption equilibration time, exclusion of endogenous compounds, and elution step) improved the sensitivity and selectivity of the method, which presented a linear range from the lower limit of quantification (0.5-20.0 ng mL(-1)) to the upper limit of quantification (32.5-10,500 ng mL(-1)), inter- and intra-assay precision with coefficients of variation (CV) lower than 15%, and relative standard error (RSE) of the accuracy ranging from -12% to 11%. The developed method was successfully used to determine five antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine) in combination with seven antidepressants (mirtazapine, paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine, and fluoxetine), two anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and lamotrigine), and two anxiolytics (diazepam and clonazepam) in plasma samples from schizophrenic patients for therapeutic drug monitoring.

Title:  Software requirements selection; Requirements engineering; Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms; Search Based Software Engineering        
Abstract: Context: In requirements engineering phase of the software development life cycle, one of the main concerns of software engineers is to select a set of software requirements for implementation in the next release of the software from many requirements proposed by the customers, while balancing budget and customer satisfaction. Objective: To analyse the efficacy of Quantum-inspired Elitist Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (QE-MEA), Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Differential Evolution Algorithm (QMDEA) and Multi-objective Quantum-inspired Hybrid Differential Evolution (MQHDE) in solving the software requirements selection problem. Method: The paper reports on empirical evaluation of the performance of three quantum-inspired multi objective evolutionary algorithms along with Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The comparison includes the obtained Pareto fronts, the three performance metrics - Generational Distance, Spread and Hypervolume, attained boundary solutions, and size of the Pareto front. Results: The results reveal that MQHDE outperformed other methods in producing high quality solutions; while QMDEA is able to produce well distributed solutions with extreme boundary solutions. Conclusion: The hybridization of Differential Evolution with Genetic Algorithms coupled with quantum computing concepts (MQHDE) provided a means to effectively balance the two issues of multi-objective optimization - convergence and diversity.

Abstract: Methodological considerations of football injury epidemiology have only scarcely been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter-rater agreement in injury capture rate and injury categorization for data registered in two different prospective injury surveillance audits studying the same two Norwegian male professional football clubs for two consecutive seasons, 2008-2009. One audit used team-based exposure (TBE) recording and the other individual-based exposure (IBE). The number of injuries recorded and corresponding injury rates (injuries/1000 h exposure) were compared between audits. Cohen's kappa and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) coefficients were calculated for injury variables. Of 323 injuries included, the IBE audit captured 318 (overall capture rate 98.5%, training 98.9%, match 97.8%) and the TBE audit 303 injuries (overall capture rate 93.8%, training 91.4%, match 97.1%). Agreement analysis showed kappa and PABAK coefficients regarded as almost perfect (>0.81) for 8 of 9 injury variables, and substantial (k 0.75) for the variable injury severity. In conclusion, the capture rate for training injuries was slightly higher with IBE recording, and interagreement in injury categorization was very high.

Title:  Energy efficiency; Electricity prices; Consumer myopia; Imperfect competition        
Abstract: The empirical literature on the energy efficiency gap concentrates on demand inefficiencies in the energy-using durables markets and finds evidence that consumers underestimate future energy costs when purchasing a new appliance. We take a broader view and also consider the impact of imperfect competition. Using data on the UK refrigerator market (2002-2007), we find that the average energy consumption of appliances sold during this period was only 7.2% higher than what would have been observed under a scenario with a perfectly competitive market and non-myopic consumers. One reason for this small gap is that market power actually reduces energy use. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we found that anammox bacteria more probably tended to aggregation by the regulation of c-di-GMP against the unfavorable environmental stresses (low temperature, aerobic condition and low pH). Further using multiple protein sequence alignment, we systematically examined the functionality of thirteen genes encoding putative c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes in anammox organism Candidatus Jettenia caeni, revealing most of the predicted enzymes were predicted to be active. Particularly, ectopic expression of jcaA, a gene encoding a protein with both GGDEF domain and EAL domain, suggested that it encoded a functional enzyme capable of both synthesizing and degrading c-di-GMP, which was clearly confirmed by in vitro enzymatic assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was simulated by the means of three-dimensional homology modeling and molecular docking. The identification of cdi-GMP turnover and its role in granulation for anammox organism provides a new perspective for regulation of its aggregation capability and further promotion of anammox performance in the application of wastewater treatment process.

Abstract: This article uses an analytical tool called dist-space to examine the structural role of guitar distortion in hard rock and heavy metal. Dist-space facilitates categorizing, comparing, and graphing the changes in a composition's distortion structure, which demonstrate distortion's capacity to generate motivic and formal structures. An application of Robert Morris's generalization of contour theory, dist-space couples sequential time to a sequentially ordered dimension of discrete distortion regions whose foundation is the distortion function F(A) - D and spectral analysis. While the process of categorizing, comparing, and graphing distortion sounds is partially subjective, the distortion function F(A) - D underlying dist-space's sequentially ordered dimension of distortion regions provides an objective foundation for measuring, identifying, and comparing distortion sounds that informs subjective judgments leading to greater intersubjective agreement between theorists, analysts, and performers. Although the primary analytical focus of the dist-space tool is guitar distortion, it has a wider range of applications. For example, it can provide analytical insights into the distortion sounds recording engineers produce from microphones, tape machines, and digital or analog signal processing, which have become an integral process of producing tracks in a studio. In fact, this study demonstrates that the guitar distortion heard on recordings is often a product of both guitar amplification and recording studio techniques.

Title:  Three-phase induction motor; Superconducting fault current limiter; Superconductor tape; Starting induction motor method        
Abstract: The typical starting current for an asynchronous three-phase electric motor is in the range of five to ten times the rated current. To mitigate problems caused by this high current, various methods to start this type of motor exist. As an alternative method for starting up induction motors, a new starting current limitation method is proposed, which is based on using commercially available high-temperature superconductor tape. A prototype of the superconducting starting current limiter was constructed and tested with a 55-kW industrial induction motor, in a 440-V/60-Hz three-phase power grid. As the total starting time can be longer than the time the superconductor tape can support a high current, a shunt reactor receives the starting current after 80 ms to avoid damage to the tape. Performance evaluations of the superconducting limiter method were performed and were compared with a direct-on-line starter and an electronic soft starter. In addition to limiting the starting current, our method offers reduced current waveform distortion and lower harmonic pollution during startup.

Title:  Hydrologic performance; SWMM; Rainwater harvesting; Source control; Storage tank; Storm water        
Abstract: In the framework of storm water management, Domestic Rainwater Harvesting (DRWH) systems are recently recognized as source control solutions according to LID principles. In order to assess the impact of these systems in storm water runoff control, a simple methodological approach is proposed. The hydrologic-hydraulic modelling is undertaken using EPA SWMM; the DRWH is implemented in the model by using a storage unit linked to the building water supply system and to the drainage network. The proposed methodology has been implemented for a residential urban block located in Genoa (Italy). Continuous simulations are performed by using the high-resolution rainfall data series for the ""do nothing"" and DRWH scenarios. The latter includes the installation of a DRWH system for each building of the urban block. Referring to the test site, the peak and volume reduction rate evaluated for the 2125 rainfall events are respectively equal to 33 and 26 percent, on average (with maximum values of 65 percent for peak and 51 percent for volume). In general, the adopted methodology indicates that the hydrologic performance of the storm water drainage network equipped with DRWH systems is noticeable even for the design storm event (T = 10 years) and the rainfall depth seems to affect the hydrologic performance at least when the total depth exceeds 20 mm. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title:  Migraine; trigeminal neuralgia; migraine-tic; trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia        
Abstract: Background: Migraine-tic syndrome was first reported in 2004 in a 44-year-old woman who had concomitant symptoms of both typical trigeminal neuralgia and migraine. We report here two further cases of migraine-tic syndrome and speculate on the relevance of this condition to the pathophysiology of headache. Case reports: A 43-year-old woman presented with typical trigeminal neuralgia symptoms that preceded the onset of migraine headache; both headache types responded to treatment with sumatriptan. A 35-year-old woman presented with trigeminal neuralgia that consistently followed the onset of migraine headache. The former aspect responded to baclofen, but the migraine headache required treatment with amitriptyline. Discussion: These two patients provide further support for the presence of an overlap syndrome of migraine-tic. We suggest that there is a common pathway for trigeminal neuralgia and migraine.

Title:  Vagus; Parasympathetic nervous system; Vagal flexibility; Heart rate variability; Biofeedback; Regulation; Altruism; Prosocial behavior        
Abstract: Our various daily activities continually require regulation of our internal state. These regulatory processes covary with changes in High Frequency Heart Rate Variability (HF-HRV), a marker of parasympathetic activity. Specifically, incidental increases in HF-HRV accompany positive social engagement behavior and prosocial action. Little is known about deliberate regulation of HF-HRV and the role of voluntary parasympathetic regulation in prosocial behavior. Here, we present a novel biofeedback task that measures the ability to deliberately increase HF-HRV. In two large samples, we find that a) participants are able to voluntarily upregulate HF-HRV, and b) variation in this ability predicts individual differences in altruistic prosocial behavior, but not non-altruistic forms of prosociality, assessed through 14 different measures. Our findings suggest that self-induction of parasympathetic states is involved in altruistic action. The biofeedback task may provide a measure of deliberate parasympathetic regulation, with implications for the study of attention, emotion, and social behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title:  autism spectrum disorder; brain circuit; synaptic patterning; visual system; lateral geniculate nucleus; eye-specific segregation; BTBR mouse        
Abstract: Aberrant connectivity is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent neuroimaging studies have increasingly identified such impairments in patients with ASD, including alterations in sensory systems. However, the cellular substrates and molecular underpinnings of disrupted connectivity remain poorly understood. Utilizing eye-specific segregation in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) as a model system, we investigated the formation and refinement of precise patterning of synaptic connections in the BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD. We found that at the neonatal stage, the shape of the dLGN occupied by retinal afferents was altered in the BTBR group compared to C57BL/6J (B6) animals. Notably, the degree of overlap between the ipsi- and contralateral afferents was significantly greater in the BTBR mice. Moreover, these abnormalities continued into mature stage in the BTBR animals, suggesting persistent deficits rather than delayed maturation of axonal refinement. Together, these results indicate disrupted connectivity at the synaptic patterning level in the BTBR mice, suggesting that in general, altered neural circuitry may contribute to autistic behaviours seen in this animal model. In addition, these data are consistent with the notion that lower-level, primary processing mechanisms contribute to altered visual perception in ASD. Autism Res2017, 10: 212-223.

Title:  Dignity therapy; end of life; terminal; palliative care; psychotherapy        
Abstract: Background: Dignity therapy is psychotherapy to relieve psychological and existential distress in patients at the end of life. Little is known about its effect. Aim: To analyse the outcomes of dignity therapy in patients with advanced life-threatening diseases. Design: Systematic review was conducted. Three authors extracted data of the articles and evaluated quality using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Data were synthesized, considering study objectives. Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO. The years searched were 2002 (year of dignity therapy development) to January 2016. Dignity therapy' was used as search term. Studies with patients with advanced life-threatening diseases were included. Results: Of 121 studies, 28 were included. Quality of studies is high. Results were grouped into effectiveness, satisfaction, suitability and feasibility, and adaptability to different diseases and cultures. Two of five randomized control trials applied dignity therapy to patients with high levels of baseline psychological distress. One showed statistically significant decrease on patients' anxiety and depression scores over time. The other showed statistical decrease on anxiety scores pre-post dignity therapy, not on depression. Nonrandomized studies suggested statistically significant improvements in existential and psychosocial measurements. Patients, relatives and professionals perceived it improved end-of-life experience. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that dignity therapy is beneficial. One randomized controlled trial with patients with high levels of psychological distress shows DT efficacy in anxiety and depression scores. Other design studies report beneficial outcomes in terms of end-of-life experience. Further research should understand how dignity therapy functions to establish a means for measuring its impact and assessing whether high level of distress patients can benefit most from this therapy.

Abstract: Background Physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children is a major problem in South Africa, with severe negative outcomes for survivors. To date, no known studies have used data directly obtained from community-based samples of children to investigate prevalence, incidence, locations and perpetrators of child abuse victimisation. This study aims to investigate prevalence and incidence, perpetrators, and locations of child abuse victimisation in South Africa using a multicommunity sample. Methods 3515 children aged 10-17years (56.6% female) were interviewed from all households in randomly selected census enumeration areas in two South African provinces. Child self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 1-year follow-up (96.7% retention). Results Prevalence was 56.3% for lifetime physical abuse (18.2% past-year incidence), 35.5% for lifetime emotional abuse (12.1% incidence) and 9% for lifetime sexual abuse (5.3% incidence). 68.9% of children reported any type of lifetime victimisation and 27.1% reported lifetime multiple abuse victimisation. Main perpetrators of abuse were reported: for physical abuse, primary caregivers and teachers; for emotional abuse, primary caregivers and relatives; and for sexual abuse, girlfriend/boyfriends or other peers. Conclusions This is the first study assessing current self-reported child abuse through a large, community-based sample in South Africa. Findings of high rates of physical, emotional and sexual abuse demonstrate the need for targeted and effective interventions to prevent incidence and re-victimisation.

Abstract: Diet-induced obesity can lead to detrimental chronic disorders. The severity of this global epidemic has encouraged ongoing research to characterize the mechanisms underlying obesity and its comorbidities. Recent evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids (SEA) in high-fat diets rapidly generate inflammation in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), which centrally regulates whole-body energy homeostasis. Herein, we will review the roles of hypothalamic neurons and resident microglia in the initiation of SFA-induced hypothalamic inflammation. Particularly, we focus on neuronal and microglial free fatty acid-sensing and capacity to produce inflammatory signaling. We also outline a potential role of peripherally-derived monocytes in this inflammation. And finally, we explore synaptic plasticity as a mechanism through which hypothalamic inflammation can modulate ARC circuitry, and thus disrupt energy homeostasis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Title:  Masticatory performance; Masticatory efficiency; Color changeable chewing gum; Occlusal function; Postoperative monitoring; Gerodontology        
Abstract: Purpose: Previous research determined the relevance of masticatory performance with regard to nutritional status, cognitive functions, or stress management. In addition, the measurement of masticatory efficiency contributes to the evaluation of therapeutic successes within the stomatognathic system. However, the question remains unanswered as to what extent modern techniques are able to reproduce the subtle differences in masticatory efficiency within various patient groups. The purpose of this review is to provide an extensive summary of the evaluation of masticatory performance by means of a color-changeable chewing gum with regard to its clinical relevance and applicability. Study selection: A general overview describing the various methods available for this task has already been published. This review focuses in depth on the research findings available on the technique of measuring masticatory performance by means of color-changeable chewing gum. Described are the mechanism and the differentiability of the color change and methods to evaluate the color changes. Subsequently, research on masticatory performance is conducted with regard to patient age groups, the impact of general diseases and the effect of prosthetic and surgical treatment. Results: The studies indicate that color-changeable chewing gum is a valid and reliable method for the evaluation of masticatory function. Conclusion: Apart from other methods, in clinical practice this technique can enhance dental diagnostics as well as the assessment of therapy outcomes. (C) 2016 Japan Prosthodontic Society.

Title:  Turbocharging; Centrifugal compressor; Heat transfer; Correction model; Experimental steady flow map; Internal combustion engine        
Abstract: In the last few years, the effect of diabatic test conditions on compressor performance maps has been widely investigated leading some Authors to propose different correction models. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of heat transfer phenomena on the experimental definition of turbocharger maps, focusing on compressor performance. This work was developed within a collaboration between the Polytechnic School of the University of Genoa (Italy) and the testing center CRITT M2A (France). In particular, an original model for the correction of compressor steady flow maps is presented and discussed. The major benefit of this method is represented by the easiness of data post-processing, the data base economy, the reduced number of geometrical and physical input parameters required and the accuracy of the solution. Besides, this model does not need an out-of-standard test bench to obtain the compressor maps. In the paper, experimental tests under quasi-adiabatic conditions developed to validate the proposed model are reported. A satisfactory agreement between measured and calculated compressor maps is highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the activity and safety of hydralazine and valproate (Transkrip) in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).Methods: Previously untreated and progressive/refractory CTCL patients received hydralazine at 83mg or 182mg/day for slow and rapid acetylators respectively plus magnesium valproate at a total dose of 30mg/Kg t.i.d daily in continuous 28-day cycles in this phase II study. The primary objective was overall response rate (ORR) measured by the modified severity weighted assessment tool (m-SWAT), secondary end-points were time to response (TTR), time to progression (TTP), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.Results: Fourteen patients were enrolled (7 untreated and 7 pretreated). ORR was 71% with 50% complete and 21% partial. Two had stable disease and two progressed. At a median follow-up of 36months (5-52), median TTR was 2months (1-4); median DOR was 28months (5-45); median PFS 36 and not reached for OS. There were no differences in median TTR, DOR, and PFS between treated and pretreated patients. Pruritus relieve was complete in 13 out of 14 patients. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed.Conclusion: The combination of hydralazine and valproate is safe, very well tolerated and effective in CTCL.

Title:  histamine imprinted polymers; Ultratraces; sensor        
Abstract: Rapid and cost-effective analysis of histamine, in food, environmental, and diagnostics research has been of interest recently. However, for certain applications, the already-existing biological receptor-based sensing methods have usage limits in terms of stability and costs. As a result, robust and cost-effective imprinted polymeric receptors can be the best alternative. In the present work, molecularly-imprinted polymers (MIPs) for histamine were synthesized using methacrylic acid in chloroform and acetonitrile as two different porogens. The binding affinity of the MIPs with histamine was evaluated in aqueous media. MIPs synthesized in chloroform displayed better imprinting properties for histamine. We demonstrate here histamine MIPs incorporated into a carbon paste (CP) electrode as a MIP-CP electrode sensor platforms for detection of histamine. This simple sensor format allows accurate determination of histamine in the sub-nanomolar range using an electrochemical method. The sensor exhibited two distinct linear response ranges of 1 x 10(-10)-7 x 10(-9) M and 7 x 10(-9)-4 x 10(-7) M. The detection limit of the sensor was calculated equal to 7.4 x 10(-11) M. The specificity of the proposed electrode for histamine is demonstrated by using the analogous molecules and other neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, etc. The MIP sensor was investigated with success on spiked serum samples. The easy preparation, simple procedure, and low production cost make the MIP sensor attractive for selective and sensitive detection of analytes, even in less-equipped laboratories with minimal training.

Abstract: In this study, we describe the complete mitochondrial genomes of Gyrodactylus brachymystacis and Gyrodactylus parvae infecting rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the invasive topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), respectively. The two circular genomes have a common genome organization found in other Gyrodactylus species. Comparative analyses of mitochondrial genomes from six Gyrodactylus species were carried out to determine base composition, codon usage, transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, major non-coding regions, and nucleotide diversity within the genus. We also provide the first universal models of the secondary structures of rrnS and rrnL for this group thereby promoting utilization of these genetic markers. Universal primers provided herein can be used to obtain more mitochondrial information for pathogen identification and may reveal different levels of molecular phylogenetic inferences for this lineage.

Title:  3NP; DHM; Striatum; Oxidative stress; Apoptosis        
Abstract: Oxidative stress is closely involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aimed to examine the effect of anti-oxidant DHM (dihydromyricetin) on 3NP (3-nitropropionic acid) -induced behavioral deficits of experimental rats and striatal histopathological injury by using behavioral, imaging, biochemistry, histochemistry and molecular biology technologies. The experimental results showed that both motor dysfunctions and learning and memory impairments induced by 3NP were significantly reduced after DHM treatment. 3NP-induced striatal metabolic abnormality was also remarkably improved by DHM treatment, showed as the increased glucose metabolism in PET/CT scan, decreased MDA (malondialdehyde) and increased SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity in enzyme histochemical staining. In addition, the cell apoptosis was evidently detected in the striatum of the 3NP group, while in the 3NP + DHM group, the number of apoptotic cells was remarkably reduced. 3NP treatment obviously induced down-regulation of Bcl-2, and up-regulations of Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3, while these changes were significantly reversed by DHM treatment. The present results suggested that DHM showed its protective effect by anti-oxidant and anti-apoptosis mechanisms.

Title:  RAS; CNT nano-composite; Destructive interference of EM wave; Sandwich construction; Flexural strength        
Abstract: RAS (radar absorbing structure) is effective for both load bearing and EM (electromagnetic) wave absorbing capability of the stealth technology. Although the RAS is usually designed to absorb the EM waves in broadband range of wave frequencies, it may be more effective to absorb the EM waves in certain frequency range as a narrow band stop filter for the specific applications. In this work, non-reflective conditions for the RAS were analytically investigated to determine the medium thickness of EM wave transmission for the destructive interference. Then, the sandwich-type RAS which was composed of CNT (carbon nanotube) nano-composite face, PMI (polymethacrylimide) foam core and carbon/epoxy composite reflector, was fabricated. The EM wave absorbing characteristics of the RAS were measured with the free space measurement method to develop high EM wave absorption characteristics. The flexural stiffness and strengths of the RAS were measured by the three-point bending method with respect to the thickness of the carbon/epoxy composite reflector. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title:  ADDITION-Europe; albuminuria; microvascular complications; screening; systolic blood pressure; type 2 diabetes        
Abstract: BackgroundIt is unclear whether cardiovascular risk factor modification influences the development of renal disease in people with type 2 diabetes identified through screening. We determined predictors of albuminuria 5years after a diagnosis of screen-detected diabetes within the ADDITION-Europe study, a pragmatic cardiovascular outcome trial of multifactorial cardiovascular risk management. MethodsIn 1826 participants with newly diagnosed, screen-detected diabetes without albuminuria, we explored associations between risk of new albuminuria (2.5mgmmol(-1) for males and 3.5mgmmol(-1) for females) and (1) baseline cardio-metabolic risk factors and (2) changes from baseline to 1year in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) using logistic regression. ResultsAlbuminuria developed in 268 (15%) participants; baseline body mass index and active smoking were independently associated with new onset albuminuria in 5years after detection of diabetes. In a model adjusted for age, gender, baseline HbA(1c) and blood pressure, a 1% decrease in HbA(1c) and 5-mmHg decrease in SBP during the first year were independently associated with lower risks of albuminuria (odds ratio), 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.62 to 0.91 and 0.94, 0.88 to 1.01, respectively. Further adjustment did not materially change these estimates. There was no interaction between SBP and HbA(1c) in relation to albuminuria risk, suggesting likely additive effects on renal microvascular disease. ConclusionsBaseline measurements and changes in HbA(1c) and SBP a year after diagnosis of diabetes through screening independently associate with new onset albuminuria 4years later. Established multifactorial treatment for diabetes applies to cases identified through screening.

Title:  Gas-liquid mass transfer; Taylor bubbles; Meandering channel; Colorimetric technique; Image processing        
Abstract: Gas-liquid mass transfer around Taylor bubbles moving in a meandering millimetric square channel was locally visualized and characterized in the present study. For that, the colorimetric technique proposed by Dietrich et al. (2013) was implemented. With this technique, the evolution of equivalent oxygen concentration fields in the liquid slugs passing through one and several bends was firstly described. In particular, it was observed how the flow structure (recirculation zones) inside the liquid slugs were twisted and split by the periodic bends (centrifugal effect), until reaching, after several bends, a uniform O-2 concentration inside the liquid slugs. The influence of the ""turning point"", joining two ""straight"" sections of meandering channel was also highlighted: a slowing down of the gas-liquid mass transfer was clearly shown. Volumetric mass transfer coefficients were determined at last by fitting the experimental axial profiles of averaged oxygen concentrations in the liquid slugs (before the turning point) with the ones predicted by a classical plug-flow model.

Title:  Polynomial B-spline; Global optimization; Polynomial optimization; Constrained optimization        
Abstract: Many problems in systems and control engineering can be formulated as constrained optimization problems with multivariate polynomial objective functions. We propose algorithms based on polynomial B-spline form for constrained global optimization of multivariate polynomial functions. The proposed algorithms are based on a branch-and-bound framework. We tested the proposed basic constrained global optimization algorithms by considering three test problems from systems and control. The obtained results agree with those reported in literature.

Abstract: This paper elaborates sequential procedures for monitoring the validity of a volatility model. A state-space representation describes dynamics of daily integrated volatility. The observation equation relates the integrated volatility to its measures such as the realized volatility or bipower variation. On-line control procedures, based on volatility forecasting errors, allow us to decide whether the chosen representation remains correctly specified. A signal indicates that the assumed volatility model may no longer be valid. The performance of our approach is analyzed within a Monte Carlo simulation study and illustrated in an empirical application for selected U.S. stocks.

Title:  Business Intelligence; Maturity Stage Management; Information Demand; Feature Technology        
Abstract: Flexibility, resource efficiency, and time-to-market are key success factors for industrial enterprises. Essential settings are set during early phases of product development as well as manufacturing. In later product lifecycle phases, the responses from the market (e.g. complains or the amount of damage cases) show the maturity stage of the products. Quality methods like TQM or EFQM pursue the goal to permanently learn from this information. Therefore it is necessary to have an adequate information supply. This article focuses on this problem in the context of maturity stage management in manufacturing engineering. The research therefore first identifies a huge gap between the theoretically discussed information supply, based on encompassing data bases, and the real existing heterogeneous IT landscapes, which have grown in history. On basis of empirical findings, industrial businesses lack in concepts that put them in a position of adequate information supply. Therefore, a generic Business Intelligence concept, developed through research activities, seems to be a promising approach. It is thus possible to combine information from product features and manufacturing information with the traditional dimensions of managerial analysis, in order to identify impacts of engineering decisions on the product lifecycle.

Title:  Alzheimer's disease; dementia; aging; brain connectivity; functional network; resting state fMRI; functional connectivity        
Abstract: Both normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been associated with a reduction in functional brain connectivity. It is unknown how connectivity patterns due to aging and AD compare. Here, we investigate functional brain connectivity in 12 young adults (mean age 22.8 +/- 2.8), 12 older adults (mean age 73.1 +/- 5.2) and 12 AD patients (mean age 74.0 +/- 5.2; mean MMSE 22.3 +/- 2.5). Participants were scanned during 6 different sessions with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), resulting in 72 scans per group. Voxelwise connectivity with 10 functional networks was compared between groups (p < 0.05, corrected). Normal aging was characterized by widespread decreases in connectivity with multiple brain networks, whereas AD only affected connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and precuneus. The preponderance of effects was associated with regional gray matter volume. Our findings indicate that aging has amajor effect on functional brain interactions throughout the entire brain, whereas AD is distinguished by additional diminished posterior DMN-precuneus coherence.

Title:  parenting; aggression; antisocial behavior; delinquency; externalizing behavior problems        
Abstract: The present meta-analysis integrates research from 1,435 studies on associations of parenting dimensions and styles with externalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. Parental warmth, behavioral control, autonomy granting, and an authoritative parenting style showed very small to small negative concurrent and longitudinal associations with externalizing problems. In contrast, harsh control, psychological control, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful parenting were associated with higher levels of externalizing problems. The strongest associations were observed for harsh control and psychological control. Parental warmth, behavioral control, harsh control, psychological control, autonomy granting, authoritative, and permissive parenting predicted change in externalizing problems over time, with associations of externalizing problems with warmth, behavioral control, harsh control, psychological control, and authoritative parenting being bidirectional. Moderating effects of sampling, child's age, form of externalizing problems, rater of parenting and externalizing problems, quality of measures, and publication status were identified. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

Title:  Calcific aortic stenosis; Multi-proteomic; Alpha 1 antichymotrypsin; Biomarker        
Abstract: Background: Calcific aortic stenosis (CAS) is the most common heart valve disease in the elderly, representing an important economic and social burden in developed countries. Currently, there is no way to predict either the onset or progression of CAS, emphasizing the need to identify useful biomarkers for this condition. Methods: We performed a multi-proteomic analysis on different kinds of samples from CAS patients and healthy donors: tissue, secretome and plasma. The results were validated in an independent cohort of subjects by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and selected reaction monitoring. Results: Alpha 1 antichymotrypsin (AACT) abundance was altered in the CAS samples, as confirmed in the validation phase. The significant changes observed in the amounts of this protein strongly suggest that it could be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying CAS. In addition, our results suggest there is enhanced release of AACT into the extracellular fluids when the disease commences. Conclusions: The significant increase of AACT in CAS patients suggests it fulfils an important role in the physiopathology of this disease. These results permit us to propose that AACT may serve as a potential marker for the diagnosis of CAS, with considerable clinical value.

Title:  secure base script; relational savoring; attachment; avoidance; reflective functioning; emotion        
Abstract: The secure base script (SBS) framework is one method of assessing implicit internal working models of attachment; recently, researchers have applied this method to analyze narratives regarding relationship experiences. This study examines the associations between attachment avoidance and SBS content when parents recall a positive moment of connection between themselves and their children (relational savoring) as well as their association with parental emotion and reflective functioning (RF). Using a sample of parents (N = 155, 92% female) of young children (53% boys, Mage = 12.76 months), we found that parental attachment avoidance is inversely associated with SBS content during relational savoring, and that SBS content is an indirect effect explaining the association between attachment avoidance and postsavoring (positive and negative) emotion as well as avoidance and poststressor RF. Findings have implications for understanding attachment and parenting.

Abstract: This paper discusses a comparative study to relate parametric and non-parametric mode decomposition algorithms for response-only data. Three popular mode decomposition algorithms are included in this study: the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm with the Natural Excitation Technique (NExT-ERA) for the parametric algorithm, as well as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the non-parametric algorithms. A comprehensive parametric study is provided for (i) different response types, (ii) excitation types, (iii) system damping, and (iv) sensor spatial resolution to compare the mode shapes and modal coordinates of using a 10-DOF building model. The mode decomposition results are also compared using a unique dynamic response data collected in a ship-bridge collision accident for ambient excitation with traffic loading, ambient excitation without traffic loading, and impulse excitation.

Title:  PET/MR; Neuroimaging; Neuroscience        
Abstract: PET and MRI are powerful imaging techniques that have been used extensively to study diseases of the brain, head, and neck. In many diseases, including dementia, epilepsy and head and neck cancers, PET and MRI play important and complementary roles in standard diagnostic evaluation. Recent advances in PET detector technology have allowed combination of PET and MRI into a single machine capable of simultaneous imaging which may offer several, distinct advantages over serial imaging and post-acquisition fusion such as decreased patient burden and improved PET imaging quantification. In addition, a PET/MR instrument potentially has the unique ability to combine time-dependent physiological and functional information from MRI with the specific metabolic and receptor specific information from PET imaging. Over the past several years, numerous anecdotal reports and several larger studies showed the feasibility of PET/MR in various brain and head and neck applications including, for example, concomitant fMRI and PET neuroreceptor imaging. Future well-designed studies with a focus on evaluating and optimizing the synergistic qualities of these combined technologies may fulfill the promise of PET-MRI to provide unparalleled opportunities to understand complex brain function and pathology.

Title:  Mechatronic design-loop; Kinetostatic synthesis; GA multi-objective optimization; PKMs; Hexaglide; HexaFloat        
Abstract: In recent years, the development of CFD simulations has increased the knowledge in fluid-structure interaction problems. This trend has been particularly important for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) and sailing boats. However, especially for these sectors, in which two different fluids are involved, the reliability of CFD prediction tools requires further experimental validations. To this end, as a complementary approach with respect to ocean wave basins, there is the need for wind tunnel aero-elastic dynamic tests. This paper presents the customization of a 6-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) motion-simulator device for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) wind tunnel tests on floating scale models. Each step of the machine design-loop is motivated and described: the kinetostatic synthesis is obtained through a multi-objective optimization using a genetic algorithm, the inverse dynamic properties are mapped on the workspace, and finally the drive system is mechanically sized using the so called alpha-beta theory. The emphasis is placed on the mechatronic design methodology, so that different mechanisms and requirements may be considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  Reconsolidation; Vicarious extinction; Return of fear; Fear-potentiated startle        
Abstract: Background: Previous studies have suggested that fear memories can be updated when recalled, a process referred to as reconsolidation. Given the beneficial effects of model-based safety learning (i.e. vicarious extinction) in preventing the recovery of short-term fear memory, we examined whether consolidated long-term fear memories could be updated with safety learning accomplished through vicarious extinction learning initiated within the reconsolidation time-window. We assessed this in a final sample of 19 participants that underwent a three-day within-subject fear-conditioning design, using fear-potentiated startle as our primary index of fear learning. Methods: On day 1, two fear-relevant stimuli (reinforced CSs) were paired with shock (US) and a third stimulus served as a control (CS). On day 2, one of the two previously reinforced stimuli (the reminded CS) was presented once in order to reactivate the fear memory 10 min before vicarious extinction training was initiated for all CSs. The recovery of the fear memory was tested 24 h later. Results and conclusion: Vicarious extinction training conducted within the reconsolidation time window specifically prevented the recovery of the reactivated fear memory (p = 0.03), while leaving fear potentiated startle responses to the non-reactivated cue intact (p = 0.62). These findings are relevant to both basic and clinical research, suggesting that a safe, non-invasive model-based exposure technique has the potential to enhance the efficiency and durability of anxiolytic therapies.

Title:  Colonization; Invasive species; Population genetics; SNPs; Genotyping-by-sequencing        
Abstract: The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) has a wide distribution in Europe and is a prominent example of a highly adaptable alien species. It has been recorded sporadically in Denmark since 1980 but observations since 2008 suggested that the species had established a free-ranging, self-sustaining population. To elucidate the origin and genetic patterns of Danish raccoon dogs, we studied the population genomics of 190 individuals collected in Denmark (n = 141) together with reference captive individuals from Poland (n = 21) and feral individuals from different European localities (Germany, Poland, Estonia and Finland, n = 28). We used a novel genotyping-by-sequencing approach simultaneously identifying and genotyping a large panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (n = 4526). Overall, there was significant indication for contemporary genetic structuring of the analysed raccoon dog populations, into at least four different clusters, in spite of the existence of long distance gene flow and secondary admixture from different population sources. The Danish population was characterized by a high level of genetic admixture with neighbouring feral European ancestries and the presence of private clusters, non-retrieved in any other feral or captive populations sampled. These results suggested that the raccoon dog population in Denmark was founded by escapees from genetically unidentified Danish captive stocks, followed by a recent admixture with individuals migrating from neighbouring Germany.

Title:  Eddy-currents; losses; numerical simulation; permanent magnet (PM) modeling; PM machines        
Abstract: The prediction and calculation of eddy current losses occurring in permanent magnets (PMs) of electrical machines is of great interest. Most accurate results are achieved using 3-D finite-element (FE) simulations, which require long computation times and elaborate models. Due to this, 3-D methods are only applied in the final stage of the machine design process. This paper presents different methods to calculate eddy-current losses in PMs by 2-D FE simulations. A radial 2-D FE solver in combination with an axial 2-D FE solver is developed enabling the prediction of the eddy current paths in three dimensions with the associated losses. This approach is applicable to both surface mounted and interior PMs.

Title:  Crohn ' s disease; IBD; mucosal healing; colitis; prognosis; individualized therapy        
Abstract: Introduction: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, immune-mediated condition with a potentially disabling and destructive course. Despite growing data on when to use a therapeutic top-down' strategy, clinical management of this complex disorder is still challenging. Currently, the discussion of top-down' strategy in CD mostly includes biological therapy alone or in combination.Areas covered: This article is based on a review of existing literature regarding the use of biological therapy in a top-down' approach for the treatment of Crohn's disease. The authors reviewed all the major databases including MEDLINE as well as DDW and ECCO abstracts, respectively.Expert opinion: A top-down' therapeutic approach in Crohn's disease is strongly supported by existing data in patients with several risk factors for a severe course of disease. Moreover, there is an increasing amount of published data recommending a more individualised therapeutic strategy to identify candidates for top-down' treatment, based on enhanced diagnostics using biomarkers. Emerging therapeutic approaches besides existing therapy concepts using biologicals may possibly redefine the top-down' therapeutic strategy for Crohn's disease in the future.

Title:  craving behavior intervention; internet gaming disorder; college students; active ingredients; depression; psychological needs        
Abstract: Craving, as a central feature of addiction and a precursor of relapse, is targeted recently in addiction intervention. While Internet gaming disorder (IGD), conceptualized as a behavioral addiction, is lack of effective treatment practice and exploration of its mechanism. This research aims to test the effectiveness and detect the active ingredients of craving behavior intervention (CBI) in mitigation of IGD among young adults. A total of 63 male college students with IGD were assigned into the intervention group (six-session CBI intervention) or the waiting-list control group. Structured questionnaires were administered at pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), 3-month follow-up (T3), and 6-month follow-up (T4). Compared to the control group, a significant decrease in the severity of IGD in intervention group was found at post-intervention and lasting to 6 months after intervention. The value changes of craving could partially mediate the relationship between intervention and changes of IGD among all effects tests (immediate, T2-T1; short-term, T3-T1; and long-term effects, T4-T1). Further, explorations of the active ingredients of intervention found depression relief and shift of psychological needs from Internet to real life significantly predict craving amelioration at both post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. Although preliminary, the current study provides evidence for the value of craving-aimed intervention practice in IGD treatment and identifies two potential active ingredients for mitigation of craving, and the long-term therapeutic benefits are further conferred.

Title:  linear optimization model; water policy; industrial restructuring; water resources management; sustainable development        
Abstract: Water shortage and water pollution are important factors restricting sustainable social and economic development. As a typical coal resource-exhausted city and a node city of the South-to-North Water Transfer East Route Project in China, Zaozhuang City's water resources management faces multiple constraints such as transformation of economic development, restriction of groundwater exploitation, and improvement of water environment. In this paper, we develop a linear optimization model by input-output analysis to study water resources management with the introduction of three advanced sewage treatment technologies for pollutant treatment and reclaimed water production. The simulation results showed that from 2014 to 2020, Zaozhuang City will realize an annual GDP growth rate of 7.1% with an annual chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions reduction rate of 5.5%. The proportion of primary industry, secondary industry, and tertiary industry would be adjusted to 5.6%, 40.8%, and 53.6%, respectively. The amount of reclaimed water supply could be increased by 91% and groundwater supply could be decreased by 6%. Based on the simulation, this model proposes a scientific reference on water resources management policies, including water environment control, water supply plan, and financial subsidy, to realize the sustainable development of economy and water resources usage.

Title:  Banana burrowing nematode; SSH; beta-1 . 4-endoglucanase; Real-time PCR; RNAi        
Abstract: We constructed a SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) library based on two populations (Rs-C and Rs-P) of Radopholus similis from different host plants and exhibiting differences in pathogenicity on Musa paradisiaca and Anthurium andraeanum plants. In order to screen the clones with significant expression differences from the SSH library, a total of 2,400 clones was randomly selected and reverse northern blotting was performed on them. Out of the 2,400 clones, 89 clones showed significant expression differences. Out of sequencing these 89 clones, distinct sequences from 87 clones were obtained. Aligning the 87 distinct sequences against the non-redundant nucleotide database (nr) in NCBI, we found that five sequences were highly conserved with Rs-eng-1b. Two of five sequences with lengths of 467 base pairs (bp) (GW395922) and 742 bp (GW395923) were further employed to perform 5' RACE-PCR and 3' RACE-PCR, respectively. Subsequently, the complete length of Rs-eng-1b (EU414839) was obtained (1,427 bp). Our qPCR result showed that expression of Rs-eng-1b in the population Rs-C with high pathogenicity on host plants was approximately 2.7 times as much as the expression of Rs-eng-1b in the population Rs-P with low pathogenicity on host plants. Furthermore, the gene Rs-eng-1b from the Rs-C population also showed expression differences amongst four different development stages. The order of Rs-eng-1b relative expression abundance from high to low was females, juveniles, males, and eggs. We further used RNAi to test whether Rs-eng-1b of Rs-C population was responsible for pathogenicity which was the first RNAi work about Rs-eng-1b. The RNAi results showed that Rs-eng-1b expression had a positive correlation to pathogenicity of the population. The longer the RNAi treatment, the less pathogenic the nematode population was. Non-endogenous gfp dsRNA had no significant influence on the expression of Rs-eng-1b and pathogenicity of R. similis Rs-C population. In conclusion, all our evidence indicated Rs-eng-1b might be a crucial pathogenicity-related gene in R. similis.

Title:  diversification; employment system; Japan; regular worker        
Abstract: The chief characteristic of Japan's postwar employment system, built around the needs of large corporations, is (a) a higher rate of lifetime employment and (b) 'deferred compensation', which is reflected in Japan's steeper age-wage profile, and relatively late-stage promotions and late-career tracking relative to comparable nations. However, a key attribute of regular employment in Japan-its 'indefinite' or 'unrestricted' nature'-has received less attention than it deserves. Companies make no guarantees regarding regular employees' duties, job locations, and working hours at the time of hiring. All are left indeterminate. The indefinite nature of regular employment is linked to the causes of many employment problems. The diversification of regular employment needs to progress to the point where 'job-specific' regular employment, in which employees' job contents are clearly defined, becomes the new 'norm'. This article presents some of the policies that must be put in place in order for this shift to occur.

Title:  person perception; first impressions; face perception; personality; ambient images        
Abstract: People readily make personality attributions to images of strangers' faces. Here we investigated the basis of these personality attributions as made to everyday, naturalistic face images. In a first study, we used 1000 highly varying ""ambient image"" face photographs to test the correspondence between personality judgments of the Big Five and dimensions known to underlie a range of facial first impressions: approachability, dominance, and youthful-attractiveness. Interestingly, the facial Big Five judgments were found to separate to some extent: judgments of openness, extraversion, emotional stability, and agreeableness were mainly linked to facial first impressions of approachability, whereas conscientiousness judgments involved a combination of approachability and dominance. In a second study we used average face images to investigate which main cues are used by perceivers to make impressions of the Big Five, by extracting consistent cues to impressions from the large variation in the original images. When forming impressions of strangers from highly varying, naturalistic face photographs, perceivers mainly seem to rely on broad facial cues to approachability, such as smiling.

Title:  Bipolar disorder; menopause; postnatal; premenstrual; hormonal mood changes        
Abstract: Objective: Although there is clear evidence that reproductive cycle events are associated with mood episodes for women with bipolar disorder, few studies have examined for relationships between these and specific clinical characteristics of the disorder. This study aimed to explore the relationship between mood symptoms associated with reproductive cycle events and features of the disorder indicative of a more severe lifetime course. Method: Totally, 158 women of at least 18 years of age participated in the study. Subjects were recruited through a specialist clinic at the Black Dog Institute, Sydney, Australia. Results: In total, 77% of women reported increases in mood symptoms during perimenstrual, postnatal or menopausal periods. These women had an earlier age of onset for depressive and hypo/manic episodes and a greater likelihood of comorbid anxiety disorders, rapid cycling and mixed mood compared to those who did not report such reproductive cycle-associated mood changes. Women who experienced postnatal episodes were also more likely to experience worse mood symptoms perimenstrually and menopausally. Conclusion: First, reproductive cycle event-related worsening of mood was associated with a more severe lifetime course of bipolar disorder, and, second, it appears that some women have a greater propensity to mood worsening at each of these reproductive cycle events. If replicated, these findings provide important information for clinicians treating women with reproductive cycle event mood changes and highlight the need for improved therapeutics for such presentations.

Title:  PRNG; Pseudorandomly enhanced logistic map; Chaos; Security analysis; Cryptography        
Abstract: In last years, low-dimensional and high-dimensional chaotic systems have been implemented in cryptography. The efficiency and performance of these nonlinear systems play an important role in limited hardware implementations. In this context, low-dimensional chaotic systems are more attractive than high-dimensional chaotic systems to produce the pseudorandom key stream used for encryption purposes. Although low-dimensional chaotic maps present some security disadvantages when they are used in cryptography, they are highly attractive due its simple structure, discrete nature, less arithmetic operations, high output processing, and relatively easy to implement in a digital system. In this paper, we proposed both a pseudorandomly enhanced logistic map (PELM) and its application in a novel pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm, which produces pseudorandom stream with excellent statistical properties. The proposed PELM is compared with logistic map by using histograms and Lyapunov exponents to show its higher benefits in pseudorandom number generator. In contrast to recent schemes in the literature, we present a comprehensive security analysis over the proposed pseudorandom number generator based on pseudorandomly enhanced logistic map (PRNG-PELM) from a cryptographic point of view to show its potential use in secure communications. In addition, the randomness of the PRNG-PELM is verified with the most complete random test suit of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 800-22) and with TestU01. Based on security results, few arithmetic operations required, and high output rate, the proposed PRNG-PELM scheme can be implemented in secure encryption applications, even in embedded systems with limited hardware resources.

Title:  Wind tunnel testing; Bridge aeroelasticity; Oscillations mitigation; Sectional model; Box girder        
Abstract: The susceptibility of bridge decks to vortex induced oscillations can be addressed through wind-tunnel testing. This paper considers the case of the Vila-Real Bridge, in the north of Portugal, which has the highest deck above ground (230 m), among concrete-deck bridges cable-stayed in the central plane. It has a single-cell rectangular box girder with a wide top flange supported by regularly spaced inclined struts. Aeroelastic studies of this precise type of deck seem nonexistent in the literature. Results of sectional model tests are presented for a selection of three distinct angles of attack and three deck configurations, including a solution, alternative to the usual mitigation measures, that solved the susceptibility to vortex induced vibration of the deck and that has no relevant additional design or building costs. With the proposed approach, bridge designers may be able to relegate the use of sections with high aerodynamic performance - but that can be more costly, pose a greater challenge in the construction, or require more time to completion - and the use of mitigation measures, to cases in which they prove to be absolutely necessary.

Title:  Polycystic ovary syndrome; PCOS; Aerobic exercise; Anti-Mullerian hormone; AMH; Obesity        
Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the change in the levels of anti-Mullerian hormone, adiponectin, weight loss and fertility parameters in obese women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome, following 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise. Methods: This study was conducted from August 2013 to October 2014 among obese women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome referred to Obstetrics and Gynecology clinic, Mansoura University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt. Patients were classified into three age-matched groups; group A had controls, group B had patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and group C had obese women. Anti-Mullerian hormone, adiponectin, follicle-stimulating hormone, oestrogen, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance, antral follicle count, hirsutism score, weight, menstrual cyclicity and ovulatory function were assessed at baseline and following 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17. Results: Of the 90 patients, there were 30(33.3%) in each group. The mean age was 28.7 +/- 3.84 years in group A, 27.9 +/- 4.1 years in group B and 27.6 +/- 5.7 in group C. The 30(33.3%) participants who responded to aerobic exercise interventions showed significant improvements in reproductive function), with lower baseline anti-Mullerian hormone levels, greater weight loss and higher adiponectin level compared to the the 30(33.3%) participants who did not respond to the exercise programme. Weight loss, fertility hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, oestrogen, antral follicle count, baseline anti-Mullerian hormone, and adiponectin were significantly correlated to the improvement in reproductive function (p<0.05 each). The change in anti-Mullerian hormone and adiponectin levels correlated significantly with physical activity level in both responders and non-responders (p<0.05). In women with anovulatory syndromes, there were significant improvements in ovarian process with an ovulation rate of 13(43.3%) and a restoration of menstrual cycle with a rate of 17(56.7 %) following 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise. Conclusion: Moderate aerobic training for 12 weeks had a positive significant effect on reproductive functions via modulating adiposity, the levels of adiponectin, anti-Mullerian hormone and fertility hormones.

Title:  idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis; rituximab; steroid-refractory hypertrophic pachymeningitis        
Abstract: Background and Purpose Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare disease caused by autoimmunity in the meninx that causes various neurologic symptoms, including headache, seizures, weakness, paresthesia, and cranial nerve palsies. Although the first-line therapy for HP is steroids, many HP cases are refractory to steroids or recur when the steroids are tapered. Here we report three HP cases that were successfully treated with rituximab (RTX). Methods From an institutional cohort recruited from April 2012 to July 2016, three HP cases that were identified to be steroid-refractory were treated with RTX (four weekly doses of 375 mg/m(2)). Clinical improvement was assessed by the number of relapses of any neurologic symptom and the largest dural thickness in MRI. Results All three patients were recurrence-free of neurologic symptoms and exhibited prominent decreases in the dural thickness after RTX treatment. No adverse events were observed in the patients. Conclusions We suggest RTX as a second-line therapy for steroid-refractory HP. Further studies are warranted to confirm this observation in a larger population and to consider RTX as a first-line therapy.

Title:  Adalimumab; clinical response; etanercept; golimumab; rheumatoid arthritis        
Abstract: Objective: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) golimumab+methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite etanercept+MTX or adalimumab+MTX therapy and evaluate whether intravenous (IV) golimumab could rescue patients who were nonresponders to SC golimumab. Methods: In this multicenter, assessor-blinded, active-switch study of patients with RA (n=433) with inadequate response to etanercept or adalimumab+MTX, patients continued MTX and received open-label SC golimumab 50mg every 4 weeks through week 12. DAS28-ESR good responders at week 16 continued open-label SC golimumab through week 52 (Group 1); nonresponders were randomized to double-blind golimumab SC 50mg (Group 2-SC) or IV 2mg/kg (Group 2-IV). Week 14 ACR20 was the primary endpoint; assessments continued through week 52 and for patients in the voluntary long-term extension through week 76. A major secondary endpoint was the proportions of patients with ACR20 response at week 52 relative to week 16 in Group 2-SC and Group 2-IV. Results: At week 14, 34.9% (p<0.001) achieved an ACR20. At week 52, patients in Group 1 (n=75) achieved an ACR20 (62.7%). In Groups 2-SC (n=91) and 2-IV (n=184), 13.2% and 9.2% had an ACR20 at week 52 relative to week 16, with no significant difference between the randomized groups; 42.9% and 47.8% achieved DAS28-ESR response relative to week 0. Through week 16, 4.6% of patients had a serious adverse event. No differences in the rates or types of adverse events were observed between SC and IV golimumab from weeks 16 to 52. The trial limitations included a higher than expected discontinuation rate as a result of a programming error. Conclusion: SC golimumab+MTX significantly suppressed disease activity in RA patients with inadequate response to etanercept and/or adalimumab + MTX. Patients randomized to Groups 2-SC and 2-IV had lower response rates than Group 1, with no difference between SC or IV mode of administration. The safety profile with IV golimumab was comparable to that established with SC golimumab.Trial registration: NCT01004432, EudraCT 2009-010582-23.

Abstract: Introduction: Methadone and buprenorphine are maintenance replacement therapies for opioid dependence; they are also used for pain management. Methadone and buprenorphine (to a lesser extent) have seen sharp increases in mortality associated with their use. They have distinct routes of metabolism (mostly cytochrome P450 dependent), and distinct pharmacologic activity of metabolites. As such, metabolism may play a role in differences in their toxicity. Areas covered: This article reviews peer-reviewed literature obtained from PubMed searches and literature referenced within. The review considers first an overview of drug use and mortality over the past decade. It then provides extensive detail on the in vitro and in vivo human metabolism of methadone and buprenorphine. Using both human and experimental animal studies it then presents the pharmacodynamic activity of parent drug and metabolites at the mu-opioid receptor, as P-glycoprotein substrates and plasma/brain concentration ratios, and activity at the hERG K+ channel. Lessons learned from drug interaction studies in humans are then examined in an attempt to bring together the combined information. Expert opinion: The use and misuse of these drugs contributes to the epidemic in opioid-associated mortalities. A better understanding of metabolism-, transport-and co-medication-induced changes will contribute to their safer use.

Title:  IL-35; IL-37; asthma        
Abstract: Asthma is a chronic airway inflammation that is characterized by intense eosinophil infiltrates, mucus hypersecretion, airway remodeling, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Interleukin (IL)-35 and IL-37 are two cytokines with anti-inflammatory effects found in immune response. Recent findings suggested that expressions of IL-35 and IL-37 are abnormal in asthma. Functional analysis further confirmed the important roles of them in the pathogenesis of asthma. The present study reviewed the updated evidence indicating the roles of IL-35 and IL-37 in asthma. Hopefully, the information obtained may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.

Title:  Cultural heritage; Digital archaeology; 3D information systems; 3D digitalization        
Abstract: Cultural heritage (CH) documentation tasks usually involve professionals from different knowledge areas, which implies not only a huge amount of information and requirements, but also a very heterogeneous set of sources, data structures, content and formats. Geographic information systems (GIS) have been used extensively by cultural heritage specialists, but this is just working around the real problem: there is no specialized software for CH professionals to document their work in 3D. In this paper, we present software named Agata that allows specialists to interact in real time with high resolution polygonal models, and to annotate different raster and vectorial information directly onto them that might be useful for current or future research. Moreover, these annotations can be exported in a standard format that allows researchers from other disciplines that might be interested in the dataset to access such information easily. The system is able to manage and annotate not only on buildings or archaeological sites, but also sculptures or paintings directly into the 3D dataset of any CH physical element.

Title:  Network security; network infrastructure; data plane attack; hardware monitor; multicore processor; FPGA        
Abstract: The importance of the Internet for society is increasing. To ensure a functional Internet, its routers need to operate correctly. However, the need for router flexibility has led to the use of software-programmable network processors in routers, which exposes these systems to data plane attacks. Recently, hardware monitors have been introduced into network processors to verify the expected behavior of processor cores at run time. If instruction-level execution deviates from the expected sequence, an attack is identified, triggering processor core recovery efforts. In this manuscript, we describe a scalable network processor monitoring system that supports the reallocation of hardware monitors to processor cores in response to workload changes. The scalability of our monitoring architecture is demonstrated using theoretical models, simulation, and router system-level experiments implemented on an FPGA-based hardware platform. For a system with four processor cores and six monitors, the monitors result in a 6 percent logic and 38 percent memory bit overhead versus the processor's core logic and instruction storage. No slowdown of system throughput due to monitoring is reported.

Title:  main cable; galloping; wind tunnel test; suspension bridge; construction period        
Abstract: Large amplitude oscillation of steepled main cables usually presents during construction of a long-span bridge. To study this phenomenon, six typical main cables with different cross sections during construction are investigated. Two main foci have been conducted. Firstly, aerodynamic coefficients of a main cable are obtained and compared through simulation and wind tunnel test: (1) to ensure the simulation accuracy, influences of the numerical model's grid size, and the jaggy edges of main cable's cross section on main cable's aerodynamic coefficients are investigated; (2) aerodynamic coefficients of main cables at different wind attack angles are obtained based on the wind tunnel test in which the experimental model is made by rigid plastic using the 3D Printing Technology; (3) then numerical results are compared with wind tunnel test results, and they are in good agreement. Secondly, aerodynamic coefficients of the six main cables at different wind attack angles are obtained through numerical simulation. Then Den Hartog criterion is used to analyze the transverse galloping of main cables during construction. Results show all the six main cables may undergo galloping, which may be an important reason for the large amplitude oscillation of steepled main cables during construction. The flow structures around the main cables indicate that the characteristic of the airflow trajectory over a steepled main cable may play an important role in the galloping generation Engineers should take some effective measures to control this harmful phenomenon due to the big possibility of the onset of galloping during the construction period.

Title:  Implicit leadership theories; Trait perceptions; Leadership perceptions; Endorsement of ILTs; Facial expressions        
Abstract: This experimental study investigated the effect of a leader's expression of happy versus nervous emotions on subsequent perceptions of leadership and ratings of traits associated with implicit leadership theories (ILTs). Being fast and universally understood, emotions are ideal stimuli for investigating the dynamic effects of ILTs, which were understood in this study in terms of the constraints that expressed emotions impose on the connectionist networks that activate ILTs. The experimental design contrasted videotaped and still frame presentations of a leadership event; however, this methodological factor had no significant effects and analyses were thus collapsed across this factor. Key findings were that the expression of a happy versus nervous emotion at the end of a problem-solving sequence had multiple effects: happy emotions resulted in higher leadership ratings, higher trait ratings, greater correlations among trait ratings, and greater dependence of trait ratings on leadership perceptions. An exploratory model suggested that leadership impressions mediated the effects of facial emotions on trait ratings. The discussion further links the study findings with interpretations in terms of ILTs and many types of constraints on these cognitive structures. It also suggests ways to integrate these ideas with advances in neuroscience research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Functioning; prodrome; psychosis; social cognition; theory of mind; ultra-high risk        
Abstract: Objective: Social and role functioning are compromised for the majority of individuals at ultra-high risk of psychosis, and it is important to identify factors that contribute to this functional decline. This study aimed to investigate social cognitive abilities, which have previously been linked to functioning in schizophrenia, as potential factors that impact social, role and global functioning in ultra-high risk patients. Method: A total of 30 ultra-high risk patients were recruited from an established at-risk clinical service in Melbourne, Australia, and completed a battery of social cognitive, neurocognitive, clinical and functioning measures. We examined the relationships between all four core domains of social cognition (emotion recognition, theory of mind, social perception and attributional style), neurocognitive, clinical and demographic variables with three measures of functioning (the Global Functioning Social and Role scales and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale) using correlational and multiple regression analyses. Results: Performance on a visual theory of mind task (visual jokes task) was significantly correlated with both concurrent role (r=0.425, p=0.019) and global functioning (r=0.540, p=0.002). In multivariate analyses, it also accounted for unique variance in global, but not role functioning after adjusting for negative symptoms and stress. Social functioning was not associated with performance on any of the social cognition tasks. Conclusion: Among specific social cognitive abilities, only a test of theory of mind was associated with functioning in our ultra-high risk sample. Further longitudinal research is needed to examine the impact of social cognitive deficits on long-term functional outcome in the ultra-high risk group. Identifying social cognitive abilities that significantly impact functioning is important to inform the development of targeted intervention programmes for ultra-high risk individuals.

Abstract: Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) has been considered a critically important region in the regulation of some of the physiological functions that fail during the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this paper, the effects of unilateral neurotoxic lesion of the PPN [through the injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) solution (con - centration: 0.1 M; volume: 0.5 mu L.)] in motor execution and gait disorders and the changes in cellular and molecular indicators in rat nigral tissue were evaluated. The motor execution was assessed using the beam test (BT) and the gait disorders by footprint test. Glutathione (GSH) concentrations, acetyl cholinesterase enzymatic activity (AChE EA), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in nigral tissue were analyzed. NMDA-lesioned rats showed fine motor dysfunction with a significant increase in the slow (p <= 0.01) and fast movement (p <= 0.01) time and in path deviation (p <= 0.01) on the smaller diameter beams. Moreover, NMDA-lesioned rats exhibited an imprecise path with moments of advances and setbacks, alternating with left and right deviations, suspensions, and inverted positions. Footprint test revealed slight gait disorders, which were manifested by a reduction in the left and right stride lengths, the intra-step distance, and the support area (p <= 0.01). Biochemical studies showed that 48 h after the PPN neurotoxic injury, the GSH concentrations and BDNF expression were significantly increased (p <= 0.01). These variables returned to normal values 7 days after the PPN lesion; the AChE EA showed a significant increase at this time. These functional changes in nigral tissue could be a plastic responses associated with early PD. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  cAMP; cytoskeleton proteins; EPAC; microtubule-associated protein expression; neuronal differentiation; PKA        
Abstract: Neurons are highly differentiated cells responsible for the conduction and transmission of information in the nervous system. The proper function of a neuron relies on the compartmentalization of their intracellular domains. Differentiated neuroblastoma cells have been extensively used to study and understand the physiology and cell biology of neuronal cells. Here, we show that differentiation of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells is more pronounced upon exposure of a chemical analog of cyclic AMP (cAMP), db-cAMP. We next analysed the expression of key microtubule-regulating proteins in differentiated cells and the expression and activation of key cAMP players such as EPAC, PKA and AKAP79/150. Most of the microtubule-promoting factors were up regulated during differentiation of N1E-115 cells, while microtubule-destabilizing proteins were down regulated. We observed an increase in tubulin post-translational modifications related to microtubule stability. As expected, db-cAMP increased PKA- and EPAC-dependent signalling. Consistently, pharmacological modulation of EPAC activity instructed cell differentiation, number of neurites, and neurite length in N1E-115 cells. Moreover, disruption of the PKA-AKAP interaction reduced these morphometric parameters. Interestingly, PKA and EPAC act synergistically to induce neuronal differentiation in N1E-115. Altogether these results show that the changes observed in the differentiation of N1E-115 cells proceed by regulating several microtubule-stabilizing factors, and the acquisition of a neuronal phenotype is a process involving concerted although independent functions of EPAC and PKA.

Abstract: This paper presents state space representation and a method of the automatic development of the small signal model of dc distribution network. The model can represent the dynamics of the converter-interfaced wind, photovoltaic generation units and energy storage system around the steady-state operating point. The presented model considers the voltages crossing capacitors, the currents through inductors, the control variables as state variables, and the variations of the wind speed, irradiance solar, loads as the control input. The whole state space equations are developed automatically. A detailed small-signal mathematical model is derived automatically by using the stamping method to analyze the small-signal stability of the system. Time-domain simulation is used to verify the method. The effects of system and controller parameters on the system performance are analyzed.

Title:  insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor; colorectal neoplasia; invasion; cell adhesion; epithelial mesenchymal transformation        
Abstract: This study examines the expression of the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (TGF-1R) in colorectal neoplasia. Previous studies have shown that the IGF-1R is expressed at high levels in normal embryonic stem cells and in many cancer phenotypes. However, lower IGF-1R levels are expressed in some advanced cancer phenotypes. The timing of and the reasons for these changes in expression during the evolution of a cancer are not understood. Here, we examine IGF-1R expression in the evolution of colorectal cancer by means of Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry validated by tissue and reagent controls and Western blotting. We show for the first time that (1) in normal colorectal crypts, epithelial stem cells in the basal crypt region express high IGF-1R levels, which decrease to low levels when these cells migrate to and differentiate in the mid and upper crypt regions; (2) in tumor initiation in aberrant crypt foci, all of the transformed cells express high levels of the IGF-1R at stem cell levels throughout the crypt axis; (3) in tumor progression in adenomatous and cancerous crypts, tumor cells of an epithelial type morphology express high levels of the IGF-1R; (4) in advanced cancers, low levels of the IGF-1R are expressed in invasive foci where cancer cells dedifferentiate to a mesenchymal-type morphology and show a loss of cell adhesion. Interestingly, these cells can form an alternating pattern with mesenchymal type cells that show cell adhesion and high levels of IGF-1R expression. In summary, this study shows that high-level IGF-1R expression in colorectal neoplasia is initiated by an abnormality of stem cell programed differentiation in the aberrant crypt focus. However, low-level IGF-1R expression is found in some invasive cancers where it is consequent to cancer cell dedifferentiation to a mesenchymal type morphology with loss of cell adhesion.

Title:  cis-zearalenone; In silico analysis; Detoxification; Mycotoxins; Hazard characterization; Bioactivity assessment        
Abstract: Among the food-related health issues, the presence of contaminants has a prominent role, due to the wide range of exogenous compounds that can occur in food commodities and to their large differences in structure and biological activity. A comprehensive assessment of the related risk is thus actually demanding in terms of time and facilities involved. In this context, the use of computational strategies can be an effective choice for supporting the hazard identification procedure at the early stage. In this work we focused on the food contaminant zearalenone by comparing the trans and cis isomers, respectively the well-known mycoestrogen and its still largely understudied isomer. We estimated the possible effects exerted by human metabolism on the xenoestrogenicity of cis-ZEN by using a validated in silica strategy based on docking simulations and rescoring procedures. Similarly, the exploitation of the most promising enzymatic detoxifying routes designed for trans-ZEN - which relies on the enzyme lactono hydrolase from Clonostachys rosea - has been assessed for the cis-isomer as well. Our results showed that both isomers can act as functional analogues with respect to xenoestrogenic activity, and several cis-ZEN metabolites with high biological potential have been identified. On the contrary, in spite of the high degree of structural analogy, the cis isomer showed a pattern of interaction with the degrading enzyme in stark contrast with that observed for trans-ZEN. For these reasons, the outcomes presented herein strongly support the inclusion of cis-ZEN in further studies of occurrence, metabolism and bioactivity assessment, and suggest the need for a dedicated handling for the cis isomer in risk assessment studies.

Title:  cosmetic industry; delivery; essential oils; microencapsulation; polymers; stability        
Abstract: Nowadays, the consumers around the world are increasingly focused on health and beauty. The renewed consumer interest in natural cosmetic products creates the demand for new products and reformulated others with botanical and functional ingredients. In cosmetic products, essential oils (EOs) play a major role as fragrance ingredients. They can optimize its proprieties and preservation, as well as the marketing image of the final product. Microencapsulation of EOs can protect and prevent the loss of volatile aromatic ingredients and improve the controlled release and stability of this core materials. The importance of EOs for cosmetic industry and its microencapsulation was reviewed in this study. Also a briefly introduction about the preparation of microparticles was presented. Some of the most important and usual microencapsulation techniques of EOs, as well as the conventional encapsulating agents, were discussed. Despite the fact that microencapsulation of EOs is a very promising and extremely attractive application area for cosmetic industry, further basic research needs to be carried out, for a better understanding of the biofunctional activities of microencapsulated EOs and its release modulation, as well as the effects of others cosmetic ingredients and the storage time in the microparticles properties.

Abstract: To investigate the cervical compensation pattern and to clarify relationships between cervical compensation and quality of life (QOL) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis. A cross-sectional study of consecutive AS patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis was performed. Forty-four patients with hyperlordotic cervical spine were assigned to group A and sixteen with kyphotic cervical spine in group B. Sagittal parameters were measured and compared, including T1 slope, cervical lordosis (CL), cervical sagittal vertical axis (C-SVA), global SVA and global kyphosis (GK). Independent factors for cervical compensation were identified. To exclude confounding variables while comparing QOL between patients with hyperlordotic and kyphotic cervical spine, 31 patients were selected as group A-1, similar to 13 patients in group B-1 in the distribution of matching variables such as age, gender, course of disease, GK, global SVA and radiographic progression assessment for AS. The QOL was assessed by Neck Disability Index (NDI) and other indices. Mean C-SVA was significantly lower in group A than in group B, whereas mean T1 slope, global SVA and GK were significantly larger in group A. T1 slope (36.0 %) was the independent factor for CL. T1 slope was correlated with CL, GK and global SVA in group A. Group A-1 showed lower NDI score. CL (59.6 %) independently affects NDI. Notable cervical compensation exists in AS patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis. The cervical compensation responsive to global imbalance was mediated by T1 slope. AS patients with hyperlordotic cervical spine present with better QOL than patients with kyphotic cervical spine.

Abstract: Landslide is the most common natural disaster in mountainous regions. It causes damages to life and properties. The study area, Calicut-Nilampur-Gudalurghat section (SH37) falls under the Survey of India toposheet 58A-7/NE (1: 25,000). The present study was carried out with landslide hazard zonation mapping on meso-scale. This paper explains how meso-zonation of landslide hazards (facet-wise) was made from investigations as per the norms given in Bureau of Indian Standard IS 14496: 1998. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) was utilized for the preparation of thematic maps on 1: 10,000 scale. The present study evaluates more detailed related factors of inherent causative factors ( lithology, structure, slope gradient, relative relief, land use/land cover, and hydrogeology) involved in landslides. This method also incorporates effects of external causative factors like seismicity and rainfall as corrected rating. In the study area, 10 different facets have been identified. This area falling in facets 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10 come under high hazardous zone, the slopes falling in the facets 1 and 5 fall in the moderate hazardous zone, facet 2 in low hazard zone and other facets 8 and 9 show very high hazardous zone. Details of this work are presented in this paper. The landslide inventory points were collected with the help GPS in this ghat section. The inventory percentage 3.3% comes in low hazard zone, 18% present in moderate hazard zone, 57.4% in high hazard zone, and 21.3% under very high hazard zone.

Title:  advanced encryption standard; photonic emission analysis attack; cryptographic chip; Hamming weight        
Abstract: The security of information transmission is of paramount importance in all sectors of society, whether civilian or defence related. In ancient times the encryption of secret messages was mainly realized by physical or chemical means, but this was later supplemented by mathematical techniques. In parallel, the breaking of enemy codes has also been a subject of intense study. To date, the only known absolutely secure means of encryption is through quantum cryptography. However, this still has to be implemented by equipment that is vulnerable to various physical attacks, so it is important to study these methods of attack, both for legitimate users and for the surveillance of criminal activities. Today, nearly all transactions have to be realized through the computer and much effort has been devoted to cracking the software. However, little attention has been paid to the hardware, and it has only recently been realized that computer chips themselves can leak sensitive information, from which a code may even be deciphered. By studying the photonic emission and the data dependency of a cryptographic chip during operation, the correspondence between the Hamming weight of the operand and the number of photons emitted may be established, based on which a simple and effective method is proposed to crack the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher chip. An experimental platform has been set up for measuring and analyzing the leaked photonic emission using time-correlated single-photon counting. An AT89C52 microcontroller implementing the operation of the AES cipher algorithm is used as a cipher chip. The emitted photons are collected when the first AddRoundKey and SubBytes of the AES encryption arithmetic are executed, and their respective numbers are found to have a linear relationship with the operand Hamming weight. The sources of noise affecting the photon emission trace have been analyzed, so that the measurement error and uncertainty can be reduced effectively. With the help of our Hamming weight simulation model, by selecting one or several groups of plain text and comparing the corresponding relationship between the Hamming weight of the intermediate values and the number of photons emitted by the cipher chip, the key of the AES encryption algorithm has been successfully recovered and cracked. This confirms the effectiveness of this method of attack, which can therefore pose a severe threat to the security of the AES cipher chip. For the next step in the future, our method will be optimized to narrow the search range, and also combined with other photonic emission analysis attacks (such as simple photonic emission analysis and differential photonic emission analysis) to improve the efficiency. A comparison and evaluation of the various methods will be made. At the same time, our current experimental configuration will be improved to obtain a better collection efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio.

Threemyelogramswere negative for leak, and nontargeted epidural blood patches did not result in symptom relief. A cerebrospinal fluid leak study using 111In-DTPA with SPECT/CT demonstrated a focal area of asymmetric activity at the left C2 nerve root. A left C2 root tie-off, targeted epidural blood patch, and Dura seal glue resulted in resolution of patient symptomatology highlighting the importance of fused SPECT/CT images in detection of an occult cerebral spinal fluid leak.

Title:  Headache; Resting state functional connectivity; Dynamic analysis; Wavelet coherence; Sliding-window        
Abstract: The goals of this study are to characterize the temporal dynamics of inter-regional connectivity of the brain in chronic headache (CH) patients versus their age/gender matched controls (CONCH, n = 28 pairs), and to determine whether dynamic measures reveal additional features to static functional connectivity and correlate with psychometric scores. Cortical thickness and inter-regional resting state fMRI connectivity were quantified and compared between CH and CONCH groups. Six cortical regions of interest (ROI) pairs that exhibited correlated cortical thickness and static functional connectivity abnormalities were selected for temporal dynamic analysis. Two methods were used: temporal sliding-window (SW) and wavelet transformation coherence (VVTC). SW analyses using three temporal windows of 30, 60, 120 s revealed that all six ROI pairs of CH exhibited higher percentage of strong connectivity (high r values), and smaller fast Fourier transform (FFT) amplitudes at a very low frequency range (i.e., 0.002-0.01 Hz), compared to those of CONCH. These features were particularly prevalent in the 120 s window analysis. Less variable dynamic fluctuation (i.e., smaller standard deviation of r values) was identified in two out of six ROI pairs in CH. WTC analysis revealed that time-averaged coherence was generally greater in CH than CONCH between wavelet decomposition scales 20 to 55 (0.018-0.05 Hz), and was statistically significant in three out of six ROI pairs. Together, the most robust and significant differences in temporal dynamics between CH and CONCH were detected in two ROI pairs: left medial-orbitofrontal left posterior-cingulate and left medial-orbitofrontal left inferior-temporal. The high degrees of sleep disturbance (high PSQI score), depression (high HRSD score) and fatigue (low SF-36 score) were associated with high degree of inter-regional temporal coherence in CH. In summary, these dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) measures uncovered a temporal ""lock-down"" condition in a subset of ROI pairs, showing static functional connectivity changes in CH patients. This study provides important evidence for the presence of associated psychological wellbeing and abnormal temporal dynamics in between specific cortical regions in CH patients.

Title:  Distal radioulnar joint; ultrasound imaging; translation; instability; forearm; pronosupination        
Abstract: A cross-sectional reliability study was conducted with 23 normal participants to establish normal values, and the repeatability and validity of distal radioulnar joint translation measurements using ultrasound imaging. Static transverse images of maximal supination, neutral and maximal pronation were examined to assess translation, using a method consistent with the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio. Translation while gripping a 1kg weight in supinated and pronated positions was then compared with non-gripping translation. There was significantly more ulnar radial translation found with pronation than supination, when compared with neutral. Gripping in pronation did not produce statistically significant changes in translation, whereas the changes produced by gripping in supination were significant. Internal consistency was deemed very high and the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio values measured using ultrasound imaging were consistent with previously documented values measured by computerized tomography. This study demonstrated that translational movement of the distal radioulnar joint can be reliably detected in healthy participants using ultrasound imaging. This may reduce dependency on other imaging modalities to diagnose distal radioulnar joint instability. Level of Evidence: 2.

Title:  Circadian; Entrainment; Depression; Photic; Non-photic; SAD        
Abstract: The natural rotation of the earth generates an environmental day-night cycle that repeats every 24 h. This daily transition from dawn to dusk provides one of the most important time cues to which the majority of organisms synchronise their activity. Under these conditions, natural light, a photic stimulus, provides the principal entraining cue. In mammals, an endogenous circadian pacemaker located within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus acts as a coordinating centre to align physiological activity with the environmental light-dark cycle. However, the SCN also receives regulatory input from a number of behavioural, non-photic, cues such as physical activity, social interactions and feeding routines. The unique ability of the SCN to integrate both photic and non-photic cues allows it to generate a rhythm that is tailored to the individual and entrained to the environment. Here, we review the key neurotransmitter systems involved in both photic and non-photic transmission to the SCN and their interactions that assist in generating an entrained output rhythm. We also consider the impact on health of a desynchronised circadian system with a focus on depressive affective disorders and current therapies aimed at manipulating the relationship between photic and non-photic SCN regulators.

Title:  comorbidity; health care costs; utilization; chronic disease; functional status; comorbidity        
Abstract: Background: Multimorbidity affects the majority of elderly adults and is associated with higher health costs and utilization, but how specific patterns of morbidity influence resource use is less understood. Objective: The objective was to identify specific combinations of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes associated with direct medical costs and inpatient utilization. Design: Retrospective cohort study using the Health and Retirement Study (2008-2010) linked to Medicare claims. Analysis used machine-learning techniques: classification and regression trees and random forest. Subjects: A population-based sample of 5771 Medicare-enrolled adults aged 65 and older in the United States. Measures: Main covariates: self-reported chronic conditions (measured as none, mild, or severe), geriatric syndromes, and functional limitations. Secondary covariates: demographic, social, economic, behavioral, and health status measures. Outcomes: Medicare expenditures in the top quartile and inpatient utilization. Results: Median annual expenditures were $4354, and 41% were hospitalized within 2 years. The tree model shows some notable combinations: 64% of those with self-rated poor health plus activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living disabilities had expenditures in the top quartile. Inpatient utilization was highest (70%) in those aged 77-83 with mild to severe heart disease plus mild to severe diabetes. Functional limitations were more important than many chronic diseases in explaining resource use. Conclusions: The multimorbid population is heterogeneous and there is considerable variation in how specific combinations of morbidity influence resource use. Modeling the conjoint effects of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes can advance understanding of groups at greatest risk and inform targeted tailored interventions aimed at cost containment.

Title:  Hypericum androsaemum; Polar constituents; Collagenase activity; Fibroblast migration; Immunomodulatory; UV-protection        
Abstract: Ethnopharmacological relevance: The top flowering aerial parts of the Hypericum species are traditionally used to prepare ointments to heal cuts and burns. Sometimes even the fruits are used for these purposes. Hypericum androsaemum L., commonly known as tutsan or shrubby St. John's Wort, is a Mediterranean medicinal plant which has been traditionally used to prepare an ointment for treating cuts and wounds. Aim of the study: To evaluate the extracts obtained from H. androsaemum red berries as functional ingredients for skin care formulations. Materials and methods: The methanolic extract was obtained by Soxhlet extraction while the aqueous extract was prepared by decoction; their composition was determined by HPLC analysis. Their biological activities were measured in terms of proliferation and migration of human fibroblasts, inhibition of collagenase activity, and immunomodulatory effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, we evaluated their photostability by UV spectroscopy and their protective effects against APPH-induced hemolysis in red blood cells (RBC). Results: The polar extracts contained significant amounts of shikimic (108,143.7-115,901.3 mg/kg) and chlorogenic acids (45,781.1-57,002.7 mg/kg). The main components of these extracts made an important contribution to a significant increase in human fibroblast migration. Both extracts were also active as collagenase inhibitors, with the aqueous one showing a greater inhibitory capacity (IC50 value of 88.1 mu g/mL), similar to that of chlorogenic acid. The kinetic parameters determined for the enzymatic reaction revealed for both aqueous extract and chlorogenic acid an uncompetitive mechanism of inhibition. The methanolic extract showed important effects on PBMCs by modulating IL-6. Both extracts proved to be photostable in the UVA/B range and protected RBC against peroxidation at low concentrations. Conclusions: H. androsaemum red berries were proven to contain phytochemicals that improve skin regeneration, hence potentially employable in skin care formulations.

Title:  Endoplasmic reticulum; Golgi; Membrane protein; Post-translational modification; Protein sorting; trafficking; targeting; Virology; viruses        
Abstract: The article summarises the results of more than 30 years of research on palmitoylation (S-acylation) of viral proteins, the post-translational attachment of fatty acids to cysteine residues of integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Analysing viral proteins is not only important to characterise the cellular pathogens but also instrumental to decipher the palmitoylation machinery of cells. This comprehensive review describes methods to identify S-acylated proteins and covers the fundamental biochemistry of palmitoylation: the location of palmitoylation sites in viral proteins, the fatty acid species found in S-acylated proteins, the intracellular site of palmitoylation and the enzymology of the reaction. Finally, the functional consequences of palmitoylation are discussed regarding binding of proteins to membranes or membrane rafts, entry of enveloped viruses into target cells by spike-mediated membrane fusion as well as assembly and release of virus particles from infected cells. The topics are described mainly for palmitoylated proteins of influenza virus, but proteins of other important pathogens, such as the causative agents of AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, and of model viruses are discussed.

Title:  Cocaine; Crack; Drug addiction; Illicit drug; DMFT; Decayed teeth; Dental caries; Cross-sectional study        
Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between crack/cocaine addiction and dental health in men. Forty crack/cocaine-addicted patients and 120 nonaddicted patients (>= 18 years) underwent full-mouth dental examinations. Decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) were identified using the criteria recommended by the World Health Organization. Crack/cocaine addiction was determined, based on the medical records and interviews of each patient. All drug-addicted patients used both crack and cocaine. The chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to assess the association between DMFT and crack/cocaine addiction (p <= 0.05). Decayed teeth showed a positive association with crack/cocaine addiction (odds ratio (OR) = 3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.68-7.92; p = 0.001), whereas filled and missing teeth showed a negative association ( filled teeth: OR = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.76; p = 0.008; missing teeth: OR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.81; p = 0.02). The DMFT was only associated with age (OR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11-4.08, p = 0.023). In the present population, crack/cocaine addiction was associated with a greater decayed teeth index and a lower filled and missing teeth index. Programs aimed to encourage self-esteem and encourage individuals to seek dental care are required for this population. Further studies using a larger sample size and studies with women are required to confirm the results.

Title:  nuts; consumption; health professionals; knowledge; perceptions; cardioprotective        
Abstract: Despite their nutritional value, population-level nut consumption remains low. Studies suggest that individuals would eat more nuts on their doctor's advice, making health professionals potentially important for promoting nut consumption. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the perceptions and knowledge of nuts and the predictors of nut promotion among health professionals in New Zealand. Dietitians, general practitioners (GPs), and practice nurses were identified from the Electoral Roll and invited to complete a questionnaire (n = 318, 292, and 149 respondents respectively). Over one-fifth of GPs and practice nurses believed that eating nuts could increase blood cholesterol concentrations and cause weight gain. The most common perceptions overall were that nuts are healthy; high in protein, fat, and calories; and are satiating. Nut consumption was recommended for reasons relating to these perceptions and because of nuts' selenium content. Conversely, reasons for suggesting the consumption of fewer nuts included that they were high in calories and fat, would cause weight gain, and concerns regarding allergies and cost. All groups of health professionals were more likely to promote nut consumption if they perceived nuts to reduce the risk of diabetes (all p <= 0.034). Education could improve health professionals' knowledge regarding the effects of nut consumption on blood cholesterol and body weight, alongside other health benefits, which should improve the advice given to patients and may thereby increase nut consumption.

Title:  Regulatory T cells; Thymic stromal lymphopoietin; Vitamin D; Immunotherapy; Tolerance        
Abstract: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4(+) T cells with suppressive function and are critical for limiting inappropriate activation of T cells. Hence, the expansion of Tregs is an attractive strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the skin possesses the remarkable capacity to systemically expand Treg numbers by producing thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in response to vitamin D receptor stimulation. An similar to 2-fold increase in the proportion and absolute number of Tregs was observed in mice treated topically but not systemically with the Vitamin D3 analog MC903. This expansion of Tregs was dependent on TSLP receptor signaling but not on VDR signaling in hematopoietic cells. However, TSLP receptor expression by Tregs was not required for their proliferation. Rather, skin-derived TSLP promoted Treg expansion through dendritic cells. Importantly, treatment of skin with MC903 significantly lowered the incidence of autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice and attenuated disease score in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Together, these data demonstrate that the skin has the remarkable potential to control systemic immune responses and that Vitamin D-mediated stimulation of skin could serve as a novel strategy to therapeutically modulate the systemic immune system for the treatment of autoimmunity.

Title:  cardiac pacemaker; cardiac rehabilitation; implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD); nursing        
Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to examine physical and heart rhythm management device malfunction complications after participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program intervention compared with usual care. Method: This study was a clinical trial of 100 patients. After randomization, intervention group patients received 8 cardiac rehabilitation program sessions for 8 weeks and follow-up phone calls. Each session consisted of exercise training, education, and psychological interventions. Data were collected at 3 points in both groups-baseline and 8 and 12 weeks after the first day of the intervention-using a researcher-designed case report form. Data were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric tests. Results: Of the participants, 59% were men, and the sample was aged 40 to 60 years. At the 8- to 12-week follow-up, there were less physical complications among the cardiac rehabilitation group (P < .001) and no between-group differences in complications related to device malfunction. By heart rhythm device type, cardiac rehabilitation had the greatest efficacy in reducing physical complications in patients with cardioverter/defibrillators. Conclusions: Cardiac rehabilitation reduced physical complications in patients with cardiac rhythm management devices, especially in patients with cardioverter/defibrillators. Cardiac clinical nurse specialists should recommend rehabilitation programs as part of postimplantation rhythm device treatment to decrease the risk of physical complications.

Title:  Parkinson disease; oxidative stress; carotenoids; disease progression        
Abstract: BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A pivotal role of oxidative stress has been emphasized in the pathogenesis as well as in the disease progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed at investigating serum levels of antioxidant vitamins and elucidating whether they could be associated with the pathogenesis and progression of PD. MATERIALS/METHODS: Serum levels of retinol, alpha- and gamma-tocopherols, alpha- and beta-carotenes, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin and 13 -cryptoxanthin were measured and compared between 104 patients with idiopathic PD and 52 healthy controls matched for age and gender. In order to examine the relationship between antioxidant vitamins and the disease progression, multiple group comparisons were performed among the early PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage I and II, N = 47), advanced PD (stage III and IV, N = 57) and control groups. Separate correlation analyses were performed between the measured antioxidant vitamins and clinical variables, such as Hoehn and Yahr stage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score. RESULTS: Compared to controls, PD patients had lower levels of alpha- and beta-carotenes and lycopene. alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene levels were significantly reduced in advanced PD patients relative to early PD patients and were negatively correlated with Hoehn and Yahr stage and UPDRS motor score in PD patients. No significant differences were found in serum levels of retinol, alpha- and gamma-tocopherols, and other carotenoids between PD patients and controls. No significant correlations were found between these vitamin levels and clinical variables in PD patients. CONCLUSTIONS: We found that serum levels of some carotenoids, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene, were lower in PD patients, and that these carotenoids inversely correlated with clinical variables representing disease progression. Our findings suggest that decreases in serum alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene may be associated with the pathogenesis as well as progression of PD.

Abstract: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is an autosomal dominant, potentially life-threatening disease, characterized by recurrent self-limiting bouts of edema involving mainly extremities, genitalia, the face, the intestine and the airways. The prevalence of HAE is in the range from 1:10,000 to 1:150,000 in the general population. HAE is frequently misdiagnosed, with delays of 8-10 years from onset of initial symptoms to diagnosis. Lanadelumab (DX-2930) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against plasma kallikrein (pKal, KLKB1), showing a potent and selective inhibition of pKal in the pM range, which by subcutaneous route in a proof-of-concept clinical trial showed long-lasting efficacy and tolerability as a prophylactic treatment for HAE. Two phase III studies to assess the efficacy and safety of DX-2930 to prevent angioedema attacks in HAE patients are ongoing. DX-2930 received orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as FDA fast track and breakthrough therapy designations for the prevention of attacks of HAE.

Title:  PAHs; 8OHdG; IgE levels; Asthma; Oxidative stress        
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known for their carcinogenic and teratogenic properties. However, little is known about the effect of PAH on our immune and respiratory systems. Hence, we investigated associations (1) between PAH exposure and IgE levels and asthma in children and (2) between PAH exposure and the oxidative stress marker 8OHdG potentially involved in disease pathogenesis stratifying by (3) sex-based differences. A total of 453 kindergarten children were recruited and provided samples. Urine biomarker of PAH exposure (1-OHP levels) was measured by UPLC-MS/MS and a marker of oxidative stress (8OHdG) was measured by ELISA. Serum IgE were assessed and information on asthma was collected. Associations between 1-OHP levels, 8OHdG, IgE and asthma were analyzed by multivariate linear and logistic regression. A mediation analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the risk of increased IgE and asthma related to PAH exposure is explained by 8OHdG changes. Urine 1-OHP levels were positively related to 8OHdG levels (per ln-unit: beta = 0.30kU/l, p = 0.002). Similar results were also found for 1-OHP levels with IgE levels (per ln-unit: beta = 0.27 kU/l, p = 0.027). 1-OHP levels (per ln-unit) were significantly associated with asthma, with an OR (95% CI) of 1.42 (1.18-1.70). In addition, 1-OHP levels were associated with asthma. It is estimated that 35% of the effect of PAH exposure on asthma is mediated by 8OHdG levels. Exposure to PAH may enhance oxidative stress and may induce asthma. The effect of PAH exposure on asthma may be mediated by oxidative stress.

Title:  Elliptic curve cryptography; Self-certified keys; ID-base key management; Large scale MANETs        
Abstract: Dynamic nature of mobile ad hoc networks combined with their lack of centralized infrastructure make security problem the most challenging issue in such networks. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a secure and efficient key management algorithm, able to satisfying the requirement of such networks and facing their specific characteristics. The proposed algorithm is a fully distributed ID-based system which is built based on elliptic curve cryptography. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm, that gives it the superiority in its field of research, is the improvement of the performance and the security strength together. The proposed algorithm is implemented with much lower communication and computation overhead in comparison with its literature works. It is also able to update the keys while it solves the key escrowing problem. It is analyzed analytically and compared with several recently proposed key management algorithms. The analysis shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison with others. Furthermore, NS2 simulator is used to do exhaustive simulations. Simulation scenarios are done for large scale networks, to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and also validate the analytical results. Results show that our algorithm could provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation with order of magnitude less computation and communication overhead in comparison with former works.

Title:  pediatric; adolescent; knee; ligament injury; diagnostic        
Abstract: In the last few decades, sports injuries in pediatric and adolescent athletes have increased dramatically, with similar to 38 million young athletes participating in organized sports annually in the United States. Starting at the age of 2 years, an increase of the incidence of knee injuries until adulthood with a peak at 6 and at 13 years of age has been observed. Due to a physiologic laxity of the ligaments, ligament injuries are uncommon in these patients, but they are getting more frequent. In the growing knee, open physis are the points of minor resistance. Therefore apophyseal injuries of the pediatric knee are more common. Diagnostics and treatment of ligament injuries of the pediatric and adolescent knees are challenging. This article presents an overview of ligament injuries in the pediatric and adolescent knee, their diagnostic work-up, and their treatment in the growing patient.

Title:  Iran; gender; gender roles; food culture        
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to reveal how gender differentiation in the food preparation and consumption behaviors crystallizes in Iran. To this end, observations were made in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, for a period of one month in 2014. Apart from the observations, in order to be able to determine gender differentiations and gender roles in regard to food preparation and consumption, interviews were also held with ten people from different jobs, genders and ages using a semi-structured interview form. As a result of the observations and interviews, it can be stated that modernizations has taken place especially in regard to eating out. However, it was found that traditional gender patterns and gender roles continue with regard to food preparation and consumption at home. In short, the food is seen as a woman's thing.

Title:  Microarray; Metabolic enzyme array; MetaChip; Cell array; DataChip; High-throughput toxicity screening        
Abstract: Due to poor drug candidate safety profiles that arc often identified late in the drug development process, the clinical progression of new chemical entities to pharmaceuticals remains hindered, thus resulting in the high cost of drug discovery. To accelerate the identification of safer drug candidates and improve the clinical progression of drug candidates to pharmaceuticals, it is important to develop high-throughput tools that can provide early-stage predictive toxicology data. In particular, in vitro cell-based systems that can accurately mimic the human in vivo response and predict the impact of drug candidates on human toxicology are needed to accelerate the assessment of drug candidate toxicity and human metabolism earlier in the drug development process. The in vitro techniques that provide a high degree of human toxicity prediction will be perhaps more important in cosmetic and chemical industries in Europe, as animal toxicity testing is being phased out entirely in the immediate future. We have developed a metabolic enzyme microarray (the Metabolizing Enzyme Toxicology Assay Chip, or MetaChip) and a miniaturized three-dimensional (3D) cell-culture array (the Data Analysis Toxicology Assay Chip, or DataChip) for high-throughput toxicity screening of target compounds and their metabolic enzyme-generated products. The human or rat MetaChip contains an array of encapsulated metabolic enzymes that is designed to emulate the metabolic reactions in the human or rat liver. The human or rat DataChip contains an array of 3D human or rat cells encapsulated in alginate gels for cell-based toxicity screening. By combining the DataChip with the complementary MetaChip, in vitro toxicity results are obtained that correlate well with in vivo rat data.

Title:  depression in HCV patients; suicidal ideation and attempts in HCV patients; mortality due to HCV        
Abstract: Hepatitis C is a great burden to the health systems in all the countries. It accounts for over 170 million infected people worldwide. Only in 2015 there were approximately 700.000 people worldwide that died due to C hepatitis. In some other countries in Africa or Asia hepatitis C accounts for approximately 10% of the population. Hepatitis C is accompanied in most cases by neuropsychological diseases, mainly depression. Depression can be seen in HCV patients before and during the IFN treatment. It can also be developed by the treatment itself. Patients should be screen for depression pre-treatment and during treatment. Support from family and relatives are also important as it helps the patients to better cope with the disease and increase their successful treatment chances. Treatment abandon is also greatly reduced when patients are assisted by a therapist during the treatment and have full support of family and relatives. There is a large spectrum of causes for depression and these causes are influenced by gender, social stigma, education, local culture, etc. On rare occasions depression can lead to suicidal ideation and attempts. Suicide attempts per se do not represent a high percentage in hepatitis C infected patients. Mortality due to hepatitis C virus is about 4% per year, with death from hepatocellular carcinoma accounting for almost half of the total deaths number. In co-morbidity cases the HCV virus together with HIV mainly hepatitis is responsible for 11% of total deaths. This is considered a high number and establishes hepatitis C as an important priority.

Title:  Intensive care; Critical care; Stress; Burnout; Health; Rumination        
Abstract: Background: The work demands of critical care can be a major cause of stress in intensive care unit (ICU) professionals and lead to poor health outcomes. In the process of recovery from work, psychological rumination is considered to be an important mediating variable in the relationship between work demands and health outcomes. This study aimed to extend our knowledge of the process by which ICU stressors and differing rumination styles are associated with burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity among ICU professionals. Methods: Ninety-six healthcare professionals (58 doctors and 38 nurses) who work in ICUs in the UK completed a questionnaire on ICU-related stressors, burnout, work-related rumination, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity. Results: Significant associations between ICU stressors, affective rumination, burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity were found. Longer working hours were also related to increased ICU stressors. Affective rumination (but not problem-solving pondering or distraction detachment) mediated the relationship between ICU stressors, burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity, such that increased ICU stressors, and greater affective rumination, were associated with greater burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity. No moderating effects were observed. Conclusions: Longer working hours were associated with increased ICU stressors, and increased ICU stressors conferred greater burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity via increased affective rumination. The importance of screening healthcare practitioners within intensive care for depression, burnout and psychiatric morbidity has been highlighted. Future research should evaluate psychological interventions which target rumination style and could be made available to those at highest risk. The efficacy and cost effectiveness of delivering these interventions should also be considered.

Title:  cellular senescence; DNA methylation; gene expression; gene regulation; microarray        
Abstract: As senescence develops, cells sequentially acquire diverse senescent phenotypes along with simultaneous multistage gene reprogramming. It remains unclear what acts as the key regulator of the collective changes in gene expression at initiation of senescent reprogramming. Here we analyzed time series gene expression profiles obtained in two different senescence models in human diploid fibroblasts: replicative senescence and H2O2-induced senescence. Our results demonstrate that suppression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated DNA methylation activity was an initial event prior to the display of senescent phenotypes. We identified seven DNMT1-interacting proteins, ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), EZH2, CHEK1, SUV39H1, CBX5, PARP1, and HELLS (also known as LSH (lymphoid-specific helicase) 1), as being commonly down-regulated at the same time point as DNMT1 in both senescence models. Knockdown experiments revealed that, among the DNMT1-interacting proteins, only UHRF1 knockdown suppressed DNMT1 transcription. However, UHRF1 overexpression alone did not induce DNMT1 expression, indicating that UHRF1 was essential but not sufficient for DNMT1 transcription. Although UHRF1 knockdown effectively induced senescence, this was significantly attenuated by DNMT1 overexpression, clearly implicating the UHRF1/DNMT1 axis in senescence. Bioinformatics analysis further identified WNT5A as a downstream effector of UHRF1/DNMT1-mediated senescence. Senescence-associated hypomethylation was found at base pairs -1569 to -1363 from the transcription start site of the WNT5A gene in senescent human diploid fibroblasts. As expected, WNT5A overexpression induced senescent phenotypes. Overall, our results indicate that decreased UHRF1 expression is a key initial event in the suppression of DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation and in the consequent induction of senescence via increasing WNT5A expression.

Title:  NSCLC; LAG-3; PD-1; PD-L1; Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes        
Abstract: Introduction: Immunotherapy targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint has shown promising efficacy in patients with NSCLC. Lymphocyte activating 3 gene (LAG-3) is another important checkpoint, and its role in NSCLC is still not clear. In this study we investigated lymphocyte activing 3 (LAG-3) protein expression; its correlation with PD-1, PD-L1, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); and its association with survival in NSCLC. Methods: The expression of LAG-3 (EPR4392 [Abcam, Cambridge, MA]) protein was assessed in 55 NSCLC cell lines by immunohistochemistry. LAG-3, PD-1 (NAT 105 [Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA]), and PD-L1 (22C3 [Dako, Carpenteria, CA]) protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and TIL abundance was scored in 139 surgically resected specimens from patients with NSCLC. We also verified results in samples from 62 patients with untreated NSCLC and detected a correlation between LAG-3 expression and EGFR and KRAS mutation and echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 gene (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement. Results: LAG-3 was not expressed on any of the 55 NSCLC cell lines. However, LAG-3 was expressed on the TILs in 36 patients with NSCLC (25.9%). Sixty patient samples (43.2%) were positive for PD-1 on the TILs, and 25 (18.0%) were positive for PD-L1 on tumor cells. Neither LAG-3 nor PD-1 was expressed on the tumor cells. LAG-3 was overexpressed on the TILs in nonadenocarcinoma compared with in adenocarcinoma (p = 0.031). LAG-3 expression on TILs was significantly correlated with that of PD-1 on TILs (p < 0.001) and PD-L1 on tumor cells (p = 0.041) but not with TIL percentage (p = 0.244). With the logistic regression model, the ORs for LAG-3 were 0.320 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.110-0.929) and 4.364 (95% CI: 1.898-10.031) when nonadenocarcinoma was compared with adenocarcinoma and TILs that were negative for PD-1 were compared with those positive for PD-1. Recurrence-free survival was significantly different in patients whose TILs were LAG-3 negative as opposed to LAG-3-positive (1.91 years [95% CI: 0.76-3.06] versus 0.87 years [95% CI: 0.27-1.47] [p = 0.025]). Likewise, LAG-3 status of TILs (negative versus positive) did significantly affect overall survival (OS) (3.04 years [95% CI: 2.76-3.32] versus 1.08 years [95% CI: 0.421.74] [p = 0.039]). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that patients with both PD-L1-negative tumor cells and LAG 3 -negative TILs have longer recurrence-free survival than patients who are either PD-L1-or LAG-3-positive or both PD-L1- and LAG-3-positive (2.09 years [95% CI: 0.90-3.28] versus 1.42 years [95% CI: 0.46-2.34] versus 0.67 years [95% CI: 0.00-1.45] [p = 0.007]). In the verification stage, high expression of LAG-3 was also significantly correlated with higher expression of PD-1 on TILs (p = 0.016) and PD L1 on tumor cells (p = 0.014). There was no correlation between LAG-3 expression and EGFR (p = 0.325) and KRAS mutation (p = 1.000) and ALK fusion (p = 0.562). Conclusions: LAG-3 is expressed on TILs in tumor tissues of some patients with NSCLC. Its expression was higher in nonadenocarcinoma and correlated with PD-1/PD-L1 expression. LAG-3 positivity or both LAG-3 and PD-L1 positivity was correlated with early postoperative recurrence. LAG-3 was related to poor prognosis.

Title:  albuminuria; chronic kidney disease; epidemiology; glomerular filtration rate; type 1 diabetes        
Abstract: BackgroundPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of death. This risk appears to be modulated by kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), its traits, and clinical correlates in a large sample of patients with type 1 diabetes. MethodsClinical data of 20464 patients with type 1 diabetes were extracted from electronic medical records. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and increased urinary albumin excretion were considered. ResultsMean age of the patients was 4616years, 55.0% were males, and duration of diabetes 19 +/- 13years. The frequency of diabetic kidney disease, low eGFR, and albuminuria was 23.5%, 8.1%, and 19.5%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis the presence of diabetic kidney disease was associated with age (odds ratio [OR]=1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.18), duration of diabetes (OR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.03-1.07), and worse glycemic control (OR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.21-1.28, for every 1% glycated hemoglobin increase). Diabetic kidney disease was also independently associated with an atherogenic lipid profile and increased systolic blood pressure. Glucose control, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with both low eGFR and albuminuria. Male gender, retinopathy and smoke were related to albuminuria, being female was related to low eGFR, while SUA levels were associated with DKD, low eGFR and albuminuria. ConclusionsIn our sample of patients with type 1 diabetes, diabetic kidney disease entails an unsafe cardiovascular risk profile. Hyperglycemia, arterial hypertension, and atherogenic lipid profile affected both low eGFR and albuminuria. Retinopathy and smoking were related only to albuminuria while being female and elevated serum uric acid were associated only with low eGFR.

Title:  absorption spectra; Pr(III); Nd (III); lysozyme (HEW); spectral parameters; rare earths        
Abstract: Pr(III) and Nd(III) can be utilized as absorption spectroscopic probes to investigate the interaction of biomolecules like Lysozyme (HEW) with Ca(II) in-vitro; the most abundant metal ion in the human body system. The spectroscopic techniques involving comparative absorption, absorption difference, and quantitative intensity analysis using 4f-4f transitions are utilized for changes in the inner sphere coordination pattern of Pr(III) and Nd(III) in solution as well as in solid state. The present study deals with an important biomolecule in human metabolism, that is, Lysozyme (HEW). The absorption spectral parameters such as the oscillator strength (P), the Judd-Ofelt (T-lambda) intensity parameters, and the Slater-Condon inter electronic parameters are calculated using chi square methods. The obtained results are used to determine the probable geometry of the complex in the solution, the nature of the bond between Pr(III)/Nd(III) with lysozyme, and the inner sphere coordination environment of f-f transitions. The results obtained from various experimental conditions are utilized to investigate the coordination changes in the Pr(III)/Nd(III) complexes caused by different coordinating sites of lysozyme, normalized bite, denticity, the solvent nature, the coordination number, the nature of bond and other parameters to mimic the interaction of the Ca(II) ion with such biomolecule.

Title:  MOOCs; STEM; learning analytics; empirical study; gender diversity; lifelong learning        
Abstract: A very high number of learners take part in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) anywhere and at any time. Some researchers give a broad overview about typical learners in MOOCs, but many questions about social, cultural and ethical dimensions of eLearning are not answered yet. Notwithstanding the above, there are a lot of worldwide initiatives for supporting girls and women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Nevertheless in some countries, especially in Western Europe, we are still far away from gender parity in STEM. In line with these two aspects this paper focuses on 100.000 learners from more than 190 countries (data collected since 2012 and enhanced with survey data) who take part in MOOCs on computer sciences offered by the online learning platform ""openHPI"". Our primary interest concerns to the following research questions from a sociological point of view: Who takes part in STEM-MOOCs (selectivity)? Which factors influence the successful participation of men and women in STEM-MOOCs and under which conditions are MOOCs able to promote gender diversity in STEM (e.g. second-chance education and re-entry into the labor market)? The aim of this paper is to raise the potential of MOOCs to educate underrepresented groups in specific fields like women in STEM by analyzing the learning behavior of different kinds of people and giving recommendations for further MOOC offers. Therefore we analyze eLearning in MOOCs in regard of the following social, cultural and ethical dimensions: o age, gender, socio-demographic background, subject field, working experience, social interaction among students (in the forum and in learning groups) and between students and teachers/tutors; o country of residence, values, gender roles; o fairness (e.g. in behalf of peer assessment) and conformity with regulations (e.g. concerning the communication via the forum). We report new results of our multivariate statistics and give recommendations for attracting more women to take part in STEM-MOOCs, e.g. with regard to the role of teachers, course design, learning materials, examples and speech geared to a diverse target group and a suitable learning environment for a very heterogeneous group of learners.

Title:  Alcohol; Alcohol abuse; Internet addiction; Internet gaming disorder; Psychopathology; Adolescents        
Abstract: In Germany, high prevalence rates for problematic alcohol use and problematic Internet use in adolescents were reported. The objective of the present study was to identify psychopathological factors associated with these two behavior patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation assessing psychopathological factors for both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in the same sample of adolescents. We surveyed a sample of 1444 adolescents in Germany regarding problematic alcohol use, problematic Internet use, psychopathology and psychological well-being. We conducted binary logistic regression analyses. 5.6% of the sample showed problematic alcohol use, 4.8% problematic Internet use, and 0.8% both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Problematic alcohol use was higher in adolescents with problematic Internet use compared to those without problematic Internet use. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were statistically significant associated with both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Prosocial behavior was related to problematic Internet use. Male gender and less peer problems were associated with problematic alcohol use. For the first time associations between adolescent problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use due to common psychopathological factors were identified. However, in addition to shared factors, we found also specific psychopathological correlates associated with these two behavior patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  cellular energetics; glycolysis; hippocampus; ketone bodies; mitochondria        
Abstract: In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in a triple transgenic (3xTgAD) mouse model of AD low glucose metabolism in the brain precedes loss of memory and cognitive decline. The metabolism of ketones in the brain by-passes glycolysis and therefore may correct several deficiencies that are associated with glucose hypometabolism. A dietary supplement composed of an ester of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and R-1,3 butane diol referred to as ketone ester (KE) was incorporated into a rodent diet and fed to 3xTgAD mice for 8 months. At 16.5 months of age animals were killed and brains dissected. Analyses were carried out on the hippocampus and frontal cortex for glycolytic and TCA (Tricarboxylic Acid) cycle intermediates, amino acids, oxidized lipids and proteins, and enzymes. There were higher concentrations of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate in the hippocampus of KE-fed mice where there were also higher concentrations of TCA cycle and glycolytic intermediates and the energy-linked biomarker, N-acetyl aspartate compared to controls. In the hippocampi of control-fed animals the free mitochondrial [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio were highly oxidized, whereas, in KE-fed animals the mitochondria were reduced. Also, the levels of oxidized protein and lipids were lower and the energy of ATP hydrolysis was greater compared to controls. 3xTgAD mice maintained on a KE-supplemented diet had higher concentrations of glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites, a more reduced mitochondrial redox potential, and lower amounts of oxidized lipids and proteins in their hippocampi compared to controls. The KE offers a potential therapy to counter fundamental metabolic deficits common to patients and transgenic models.

Title:  Friction compensation; pneumatic servo system; sliding mode control; synchro-PID controller        
Abstract: Pneumatic systems have been widely used in industrial applications because of their well-known advantages. However, pneumatic systems possess several disadvantages that include strong non-linearity and low natural frequency. These drawbacks make it difficult to obtain satisfactory control performances in comparison to hydraulic and electromechanical systems. In this paper, the fundamental characteristics and nonlinear synchronous control strategy of pneumatic systems are studied. A two-layer sliding mode synchro-system based on friction compensation is applied to electro-pneumatic cylinders and a synchro-PID controller is utilized for position tracking. To validate the developed strategy, experiments with bi-cylinder electro-pneumatic systems were performed. The experimental results demonstrate that the synchronous position control scheme is effective in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Title:  Episodic memory; False memory; Recognition; Recollection; ERPs; Retrieval; Retrieval monitoring        
Abstract: There is keen interest in what enables rememberers to differentiate true from false memories and which strategies are likely to be the most effective. This study measured electrical brain activity while healthy young adults performed a mnemonic discrimination task, deciding whether color pictures had been studied, were similar to studied pictures (lures), or were new. Between 500 and 800 ms post-stimulus, event-related potentials (ERPs) for correctly recognized studied pictures and falsely recognized lures compared to those for correctly rejected novel items had a left centroparietal scalp distribution. This was typical of the parietal old/new effect associated with recollection, and in line with previous evidence that similar lures may elicit false or phantom recollection as opposed to just familiarity. There was no evidence of a parietal effect for correctly rejected lures as would be expected if recall-to-reject was used. The ERP old/new effects for lures also varied with individual differences in performance. Parietal effects for falsely recognized lures were larger in better performers, who successfully rejected a greater number of lures as ""similar"". The better performers also showed more pronounced right frontocentral old/new effects between 800 and 1100 ms for correctly rejected and falsely recognized similar lures. The enhancement of false recollection in better performers implies false recognition of lures occurred only when more specific information was recovered about the study episodic. Together, the findings suggest reliance on recollection to decide that items were studied, supported by post-retrieval processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  telomerase; hTERT; promoter methylation; colorectal cancer; telomere length        
Abstract: Colorectal cancers exhibit a high telomerase activity, usually correlated with the hypermethylation of the promoter of its hTERT catalytic subunit. Although telomerase is not expressed in normal tissue, certain proliferative somatic cells such as intestinal crypt cells have demonstrated telomerase activity. The aim of this study was to determine whether a correlation exists between telomerase activity, levels of hTERT methylation and telomere length in tumoral and normal colorectal tissues. Tumor, transitional and normal tissues were obtained from 11 patients with a colorectal cancer. After bisulfite modification of genomic DNA, hTERT promoter methylation was analyzed by methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA). Telomerase activity and telomere length were measured by a fluorescent-telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay and by Southern blotting, respectively. A significant increase of hTERT methylation and telomerase activity, and a reduction of the mean telomere length were observed in the tumor tissues compared to the transitional and normal mucosa. In the transitional and normal mucosa, telomerase activity was significantly lower than that in tumor tissues, even with high levels of hTERT methylation. Nevertheless, hTERT promoter methylation was not linearly correlated to telomerase activity. These data indicate that hTERT promoter methylation is a necessary event for hTERT expression, as is telomerase activity. However, methylation is not sufficient for hTERT activation, particularly in normal colorectal cells.

Title:  Green building; Indoor environmental quality; Multi-objective optimization; Sensitivity analysis; NSGA-II        
Abstract: The green building assessment emphasizes the indoor environment quality (IEQ) by looking into the indoor air quality, lighting quality, acoustics, ventilation and thermal comfort conditions, which can be enhanced by effective initiatives at the early design stage. Designers and engineers usually consider exploiting passive designs to achieve a sustainable goal in building projects. In such background, this paper presents a holistic passive design approach by incorporating a robust sensitivity analysis to an efficient multi-objective optimization process to assess a typical high-rise residential building in hot and humid regions like Hong Kong. EnergyPlus and jEPlus are adopted to conduct modelling experiments with an input parametric matrix generated by the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). All related indoor environment performance indices including the daylight, natural ventilation and thermal comfort are treated as optimization objectives and constraints to fulfil the local green building guidance. The non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is coupled with jEPlus to obtain the Pareto frontier by thoroughly searching the problem space constructed with screened out significant input variables from the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, different post-optimization analysis methods are applied to decide the final optimum solution, where the total unmet time decreased by 11.2% in contrast with the baseline case.

- Fossils and prehistoric life:
  The scientific investigation of ancient life forms preserved in geological contexts, examining fossilized remains and traces of organisms from past geological periods to reconstruct evolutionary history, biodiversity patterns, ecological relationships, and environmental conditions throughout Earth's history, encompassing specialized studies of fossil plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates.

- Biology:
  The scientific study of living organisms and life processes at multiple levels of organization, from molecular and cellular mechanisms to physiological systems, genetic inheritance, evolutionary relationships, and ecological interactions, employing experimental and observational methods to understand the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of living things.

- Plants:
  The scientific study of plant life encompassing their classification, structure, physiology, reproduction, evolution, and ecological roles, investigating photosynthetic organisms from microscopic algae to complex flowering plants and trees through botanical disciplines including plant anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, and ecology, with particular attention to major plant groups such as angiosperms, gymnosperms, and cryptogams.

- Animals (Zoology):
  The scientific study of animal life encompassing their classification, anatomy, physiology, behavior, evolution, and ecological relationships, investigating multicellular organisms from simple invertebrates to complex vertebrates through zoological disciplines that examine animal structure, function, development, distribution, and interactions within ecosystems, with specialized studies of major animal groups including arthropods, mollusks, and chordates.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:
{
  ""predictions"": [
    {""category"": ""<exact allowed name>"", ""confidence"": <float 0.00 to 1.00>},
    ...
  ]
}
5) confidence MUST be a float in [0, 1] with up to 2 decimal places.

Title:  Methylation; epigenetic; uterine cervix; human papilloma virus; BRMS1; cancer        
Abstract: Cervical cancer is strongly related to certain high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection. Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) is a tumor suppressor gene, its expression being regulated by DNA promoter methylation in several types of cancers. This study aims to evaluate the methylation status of BRMS1 promoter in relation to high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection and the development of pre-cancerous lesions and describe the pattern of BRMS1 protein expression in normal, high-risk types of human papilloma virus-infected pre-cancerous and malignant cervical epithelium. We compared the methylation status of BRMS1 in cervical smears of 64 women with no infection by high-risk types of human papilloma virus to 70 women with proven high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection, using real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The expression of BRMS1 protein was described by immunohistochemistry in biopsies from cervical cancer, pre-cancerous lesions, and normal cervices. Methylation of BRMS1 promoter was detected in 37.5% of women with no high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection and was less frequent in smears with high-risk types of human papilloma virus (11.4%) and in women with pathological histology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) (11.9%). Methylation was detected also in HeLa cervical cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear BRMS1 protein staining in normal high-risk types of human papilloma virus-free cervix, in cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, and in malignant tissues, where staining was occasionally also cytoplasmic. In cancer, expression was stronger in the more differentiated cancer blasts. In conclusion, BRMS1 promoter methylation and aberrant protein expression seem to be related to high-risk types of human papilloma virus-induced carcinogenesis in uterine cervix and is worthy of further investigation.
