Title:  Data structures  
Abstract: In this paper two approaches for the computation of the, shape diameter function (SDF) on the GPU are outlined and compared. The SDF is a scalar function describing the local thickness of an object. It can be used for consistent mesh partitioning and skeletonization. In the first approach, we have reorganized the tracing of the rays to be well suited for the rasterization hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to show how to compute the SDF using only the rasterization hardware and without the need of any acceleration data structures. The second approach uses parallel ray casting and an octree traversal using OpenCL. We demonstrate that the first method achieves similar results as the ray casting using OpenCL. In addition, it is faster for large meshes and it is simpler to implement. Furthermore, we extend the SDF computation by fast post-processing using texture-space diffusion. The fast SDF computation can be used in many applications such as the automatic skeleton extraction as we demonstrate in the article. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Future of law and economics
Abstract: In a concise, compelling argument, one of the founders and most influential advocates of the law and economics movement divides the subject into two separate areas, which he identifies with Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The first, Benthamite, strain, “economic analysis of law,” examines the legal system in the light of economic theory and shows how economics might render law more effective. The second strain, law and economics, gives equal status to law, and explores how the more realistic, less theoretical discipline of law can lead to improvements in economic theory. It is the latter approach that Judge Calabresi advocates, in a series of eloquent, thoughtful essays that will appeal to students and scholars alike.

Title:  Construction Management  
Abstract: Building design and construction require the collective effort of diverse project participants. The coordination performance of these project participants is important for effective management and needs to be assessed periodically. However, there is no uncomplicated quantitative way to measure coordination. Measuring coordination is cumbersome and time-consuming particularly during the project execution phase. This study proposes an easy procedure for monitoring the coordinative performance of project participants. The degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality measures of the project participants in a wayfinding signage project at a major airport construction project are calculated using social network analysis on the e-mail communication network between the participants. A centrality index is defined for each firm based on the average of these three centrality measures. The firm's coordination score is also calculated based on content analysis of the sent and received e-mails between the participants. The coordination scores are found to be highly correlated with the centrality indices. To define the coordinative role of a firm, its centrality index could therefore be measured easily using a simple software and only the number and direction of e-mails exchanged between the participants rather than performing cumbersome and time-consuming content analysis of exchanges to calculate coordination scores.

Title:  Anxiety  
Abstract: Background and objectives The majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are diagnosed and treated in primary care. The aim of this study was to investigate the implementation of the Rome criteria in daily primary care clinical practice and adherence of general practitioners (GPs) to recommended diagnostic approaches for IBS. Patients and methods A survey consisting of 18 questions was distributed across 11 European countries and was used to assess GPs' diagnostic approach of IBS, the use of Rome criteria in daily practice and GPs' perspective on the aetiology of the disorder. Results Overall, 185 GPs completed the survey. In daily clinical practice, 32% of GPs reported that they usually make a positive diagnosis on the basis of symptoms only, whereas 36% of GPs reported regular use of the Rome criteria to diagnose IBS. Furthermore, 62% of the responders reported that they applied additional diagnostics, such as blood tests, 31% found it necessary to perform endoscopy to make a positive diagnosis of IBS and 29% referred patients with IBS to a specialist. Psychological factors were the most frequently selected potential aetiological factor of IBS (88% of GPs). Overall, 52% of GPs reported systematically including questions on psychological symptoms in the assessment of history of IBS. Conclusion Only about one-third of GPs regularly used the Rome criteria to diagnose IBS. In daily primary care practice, IBS largely remains a diagnosis of exclusion. This has implications in terms of GPs' specialty training and questions the applicability of IBS guidelines in daily care, which advocate an early, positive, symptom-based diagnosis.

Title:  network security  
Abstract: As one of the most reliable technologies, network intrusion detection system (NIDS) allows the monitoring of incoming and outgoing traffic to identify unauthorised usage and mishandling of attackers in computer network systems. To this extent, this paper investigates the experimental performance of Snort-based NIDS (S-NIDS) in a practical network with the latest technology in various network scenarios including high data speed and/or heavy traffic and/or large packet size. An effective testbed is designed based on Snort using different muti-core processors, e.g., i5 and i7, with different operating systems, e.g., Windows 7, Windows Server and Linux. Furthermore, considering an enterprise network consisting of multiple virtual local area networks (VLANs), a centralised parallel S-NIDS (CPS-NIDS) is proposed with the support of a centralised database server to deal with high data speed and heavy traffic. Experimental evaluation is carried out for each network configuration to evaluate the performance of the S-NIDS in different network scenarios as well as validating the effectiveness of the proposed CPS-NIDS. In particular, by analysing packet analysis efficiency, an improved performance of up to 10% is shown to be achieved with Linux over other operating systems, while up to 8% of improved performance can be achieved with i7 over i5 processors.

Title:  Construction Management  
Abstract: Cash flow information is crucial for the decision making process in construction management. Due to the complexity and the dynamic progress of a construction project, forecasting cash flow demand throughout various phases of the project remains a challenging problem. This article presents a novel inference model, named as Adaptive Timedependent Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVMAT) for cash flow prediction. In the LS-SVMAT, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is integrated with an adaptive time function (ATF) to generalize the inputoutput mapping of cash flow. Since cash flow data are time-dependent, data points recorded in different periods can contribute dissimilarly to the training process of the prediction model. Thus, the role of the ATF is to determine the appropriate weight associated with each data point at a specific time period. By doing so, LS-SVMAT can better deal with the dynamic nature of the time series. Furthermore, to identify the optimal parameters for the inference model, Differential Evolution (DE) based cross validation process is utilized in this research. Comparing to other benchmark methods, the proposed model has identified the most appropriate time function and has yielded superior forecasting results. Therefore, LS-SVMAT can be a promising tool for construction managers in cash flow prediction.

Title:  Medicare  
Abstract: Objective: To identify potential risk factors associated with rehospitalization among Medicare recipients with heart failure (HF) receiving telehomecare. Materials and Methods: This study is a nonexperimental, cross-sectional secondary data analysis of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) mandated assessment called the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)-C, provided by a large home care company. A total of 526 patients who received telehomecare from January 1, 2011 to August 31, 2013 were included in the analyses, which used multiple logistic regression. Results: The overall rate of rehospitalization was 36% while patients were receiving telehomecare. Moderately frail health status (p = 0.01), the presence of severe pain (p = 0.01), the presence of dermatologic problems (p = 0.03), and independence in dressing one's lower body (compared to slightly dependent [p = 0.01] or mostly dependent patient groups [p = 0.02]) were identified as risk factors for rehospitalization. Conclusions: The risk factors identified from this study may be used to drive more effective telehomecare placements, and referrals for additional services among telehomecare patients with HF.

Title: Satellite ;
Abstract: This publication comprises three volumes in a slipcase dealing with two separate projects: Satellite and Circular Wait. New for this project as a whole is the third book Second Nature. In Martina Hoogland Ivanow's most recent work, the series Circular Wait (2010-2014), she has focused on examining our oftentimes artificial and contradictory relationship with nature - a relationship that is largely about control. Like Satellite (2009-10), Circular Wait proceeds from the longing for the authentic and wild that is fundamental to many subcultures that to a greater or lesser degree distance themselves from urban culture. Seeking to live in harmony with nature is often exclusive and only accessible to a select few. Other problematic dimensions include issues of sustainability and gender.

Here are six pieces written in 1968 from the Points West Saturday Evening Post column Joan Didion shared from 1964 to 1969 with her husband, John Gregory Dunne about: American newspapers; a session with Gamblers Anonymous; a visit to San Simeon; being rejected by Stanford; dropping in on Nancy Reagan, wife of the then-governor of California, while a TV crew filmed her at home; and an evening at the annual reunion of WWII veterans from the 101st Airborne Association at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Here too is a 1976 piece from the New York Times magazine on Why I Write; a piece about short stories from New West in 1978; and from The New Yorker, a piece on Hemingway from 1998, and on Martha Stewart from 2000. Each one is classic Didion: incisive, bemused, and stunningly prescient--

Title: Human cognitive neuropsychology 
Abstract: Cognitive neuropsychology seeks to understand impairments of specific cognitive functions in relation to a model of normal cognitive processing. The conclusions drawn from the study of abnormal processes are in turn used in the development and testing of theories of normal cognition. First published in 1988, this seminal book represented an attempt to synthesize and systematize progress in the study of cognitive neuropsychology and therefore provides an important snapshot of the field at the time. In addition to reviewing different forms of impairment and discussing their implications for theories of normal function, this book also examines the empirical and theoretical foundations of the subject including the use of single-case studies and the assumptions that must be made about the mind and brain. This classic edition marks 25 years in print, and includes a brand new introduction written by the authors, Andy Ellis and Andy Young. It will be important reading for students of cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology--Provided by publisher.

Title:  Polycythemia Vera  
Abstract: The classical chromosome Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of disorders that share clinical, hematological, and histological features. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are elevated in patients with MPN. The aim of this study was to verify the association between the polymorphisms of TNF gene (-308G/A and-238 G/A) in BCR-ABL-negative MPN in our population. Blood samples obtained from MPN patients were genotyped for the JAK2V617F mutation and both TNF polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP. Thirty three (26.8%) patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 35 (28.7%) essential thrombocythemia (ET), 22 (17.7%) primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and 33 (26.8%) with unclassifiable MPN (MPNu) were included in the study. The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 94 (76.42%) patients. Were observed a significant increase on the frequency of the TNF-238 GA genotype in MPN patients compared to controls (OR = 221, 95% Cl = 1.02-4.80, P < 0.04). The distribution of the genotypes and allelic frequencies of TNF-308 was significantly different among the MPNs, JAK2V617F positive, PV and PMF, and controls. Our data has demonstrated that the polymorphisms on TNF-238 GA, TNF-308 GA were associated to MPN development in this population, triggered by JAK2 V617F mutation. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title:  Child abuse  
Abstract: Child maltreatment can lead to acute and long-term consequences, and it is important that at-risk children are identified early. Child healthcare (CHC) nurses in Sweden are in a position to identify child maltreatment, as they follow children and their parents from the child's birth to school age. Therefore, the aim was to describe CHC nurses' experiences when encountering families in which child maltreatment was identified or suspected. Individual open interviews with eight CHC nurses were performed and analysed using a qualitative content analysis. Findings revealed that keeping the child in focus, while supporting the family was essential for the nurses. This family-centred approach was assumed to benefit the child's interests. Meeting families where child maltreatment was identified or suspected influenced the nurses, emotionally in different ways. Nevertheless, it was important to keep an open mind and communication build on honesty. Furthermore, the nurses requested professional supervision in order to help them learn from the situation ahead of the next time. This knowledge about CHC nurses' experiences may form a basis for the development of interventions that aim to support the CHC nurses in their professional role, and thereby improve support to children and parents in the future.

Abstract: In our current situation, intelligent energy management is essential, it is necessary not only change the way how it is delivered, but also how users use it. Small changes in our life daily, such as turning off lights or air conditioning when there are not people who use it, can result in substantial energy savings. In this document, we provide information about of a support system for energy conservation using sensors, actuators and agents. The wireless network system is an embedded interconnected. Agents, sensors for monitoring a room and actuators for gradually manipulate elements like windows, blinds, led lamps and air conditioning, besides the application of optimization techniques and fuzzy logic. The energy required to give comfort, comes from two main sources possible, artificial (by the company supply electricity) and natural (natural air flows, solar lighting, etc.). Our main goal is through bio-inspired optimization algorithms and fuzzy logic control provides an adequate lighting and temperature settings according to an activity that takes place in the room.

Title: End of night
Abstract: A brilliantly starry night is one of nature's most thrilling wonders. Yet in our world of nights as bright as day, most of us no longer experience true darkness. Eight out of ten Americans born today won't ever live where they can see the Milky Way. And exposure to artificial light at night has been cited as a factor in health concerns ranging from poor sleep to cancer. Paul Bogard travels the globe to find the night, blending personal narrative, natural history, health, science, and folklore to shed light on darkness. Showing exactly what we've lost, what we have left, and what we might hope to regain, he attempts nothing less than a restoration of how we see the spectacularly primal, wildly dark night sky.

Title:  Immunology  
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Characterizing associations between the upper and lower airways is important for asthma management. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the determinants of incomplete asthma control in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. METHODS: Multiple factors including age, sex, atopy, smoking history, medication use, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score, FEV1, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (F-ENO), and rhinitis questionnaire score were examined. AR was defined by rhinitis symptoms and the sensitization to inhaled allergens. ACQ was used to dichotomize the subjects into the incompletely controlled group (ACQ score >= 0.75) and the well-controlled group. The factors that contribute to incomplete asthma control were assessed by a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 260 patients with AR and asthma were enrolled and 108 patients (42%) were classified as incomplete asthma control. The incompletely controlled group was older (P<.05), and had more airflow limitation, more airway inflammation, and more severe rhinitis symptoms (all P<.001). In contrast, the well-controlled group was more likely to be taking nasal corticosteroids (NCSs) (P<.01). In a multivariate model adjusted by age, asthma treatment, airflow limitation, and FENO, persistence and severity of rhinitis (odds ratio [OR], 2.57; 95% CI, 1.41-4.70, and OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.10-3.65) and nonuse of NCSs (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.50-9.81) were independently associated with incomplete asthma control. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence and severity of AR and the use of NCSs were associated with the level of asthma control in patients with AR and asthma. Further studies are required to determine whether appropriate treatment of rhinitis would improve asthma control. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology

Title:  Attention  
Abstract: The reliance on sales taxation has increased in both states and counties. This study aggregated county-level data and empirically explored the associations between state-local sales taxes and economic activity by industry types in county governments for the period of 1990-2013. The results revealed negative associations of sales tax rates with economic activity, especially in the manufacturing industry. Further, the findings provided the spatial dependence of economic activity across counties as a form of possible spillover. This study suggests that policymakers should pay attention to how the manufacturing and retail industries respond to any changes in sales tax rates for business activity.

Title:  Weight Loss  
Abstract: Cissus quadrangularis L. (Cissus) is a medicinal plant commonly used for centuries for various conditions, but lacks critical appraisal of its clinical effects. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of Cissus in all conditions. Publications from 12 electronic databases were searched from inception through November 2016. A total of nine studies with 1108 patients were included. Each outcome was pooled using a random effects model. Effects of Cissus on hemorrhoid symptoms were not different from any comparators but had significant effects on bone pain. Effects of Cissus combination products on body weight reduction, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar were superior to placebo, with weighted mean difference of -5.19 kg (-8.82, -1.55), -14.43 mg/dl (-20.06, -8.80), -37.50 mg/dl (-48.71, -26.29), -50.50 mg/dl (-70.97, -30.04), and -10.39 mg/dl (-14.60, -6.18), respectively. No serious adverse effects were reported. Quality of evidence based on Grades of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) indicated low (bone fractures) to high quality (hemorrhoids, body weight reduction).In conclusion, Cissus had benefit for bone fractures, but not for hemorrhoids. For obesity/overweight, only combination products are pooled and show benefit. However, high-quality studies remain needed. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title:  Bipolar Disorder  
Abstract: Depression is one the world leading global burdens leading to various comorbidities. Lithium as a mainstay in the treatment of depression is still considered gold standard treatment. Similar to lithium another agent agmatine has also central protective role against depression. Since, both agmatine and lithium modulate various effects through interaction with NMDA receptor, therefore, in current study we aimed to investigate the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of agmatine with lithium in mouse force swimming test. Also to know whether if such effect is due to interaction with NMDA receptor. In our present study we found that when potent dose of lithium (30 mg/kg) was administered, it significantly decreased the immobility time. Also, when subeffective dose of agmatine (0.01 mg/kg) was coadministered with subeffective dose of lithium (3 mg/kg), it potentiated the antidepressant-like effect of subeffective dose of lithium. For the involvement of NMDA receptor in such effect, we administered NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg) with a combination of subeffective dose of lithium (3 mg/kg) and agmatine (0.001 mg/kg). A significant antidepressant-like effect was observed. Furthermore, when subeffective dose (50 and 75 mg/kg) of NMDA was given it inhibited the synergistic effect of agmatine (0.01 mg/kg) with lithium (3 mg/kg). Hence, our finding demonstrate that agmatine have synergistic effect with lithium which is mediated by NMDA receptor pathway (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Title: Democracy`s discontent
Abstract: Despite the success of American life in the last half-century - unprecedented affluence, greater social justice for women and minorities, the end of the Cold War - our politics is rife with discontent. Americans are frustrated with government. We fear we are losing control of the forces that govern our lives, and that the moral fabric of community - from neighborhood to nation - is unraveling around us. What ails democracy in America today, and what can be done about it? Democracy`s Discontent traces our political predicament to a defect in the public philosophy by which we live. In a searching account of current controversies over the role of government, the scope of rights and entitlements, and the place of morality in politics, Michael Sandel identifies the dominant public philosophy of our time and finds it flawed. The defect, Sandel maintains, lies in the impoverished vision of citizenship and community shared by Democrats and Republicans alike. American politics has lost its civic voice, leaving both liberals and conservatives unable to inspire the sense of community and civic engagement that self-government requires. In search of a public philosophy adequate to our time, Sandel ranges across the American political experience, recalling the arguments of Jefferson and Hamilton, Lincoln and Douglas, Holmes and Brandeis, FDR and Reagan. He relates epic debates over slavery and industrial capitalism to contemporary controversies over the welfare state, religion, abortion, gay rights, and hate speech.

Title:  Attention  
Abstract: The soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is an important indicator in ecosystem service assessments. Even though a considerable fraction of the total stock is stored in the subsoil, current assessments often consider the topsoil only. Furthermore, mapping efforts are hampered by the limited spatial density of these topsoil measurements. The aim of this study was to assess the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm of soil in 30,556 ha of Low-Input High-Diversity systems, such as nature reserves, in Flanders (Belgium) and compare this estimate with the stock found in the topsoil (upper 15 cm). To this end, we combined depth extrapolation of 139 measurements limited to the topsoil with four digital soil mapping techniques: multiple linear regression, boosted regression trees, artificial neural networks and least-squares support vector machines. Particular attention was given to vegetation characteristics as predictors. For both the stock in the upper 15 cm and 100 cm, a boosted regression trees approach was most informative as it resulted in the lowest cross-validation errors and provided insights in the relative importance of predictors. The predictors of the stock in the upper 100 cm were soil type, groundwater level, clay fraction and community weighted mean (CWM) and variance (CWV) of plant height. These predictors, together with the CWM of specific leaf area, aboveground biomass production, CWV and CWM of rooting depth, terrain slope, CWM of mycorrhizal associations and species diversity also explained the topsoil stock. Our total stock estimates show that focusing on the topsoil (1.63 Tg OC) only considers 36% of the stock in the upper 100 cm (4.53 Tg OC). Given the magnitude of subsoil OC and its dependency on typical ecosystem characteristics, it should not be neglected in regional ecosystem service assessments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Title: What do you say after you say hello?
Abstract: In this book, Dr Eric Berne reveals how everyone's life follows a predetermined script - a script they compose for themselves during early childhood. The script may be a sad one, it may be a successful one; it decides how a person will relate to their colleagues, what sort of person they will marry, how many children they will have, and even what circumstances they will die in. What Do You Say After You Say Hello? demonstrates how each life script gets written, how it works and, more importantly, how anyone can improvise or change their script to make a happy ending. It gives you the insight to recognise the underlying motivations behind your actions and better understand your own psychology.--Publisher's website.

Title: Judd 
Abstract: Published to accompany the first US retrospective exhibition of Donald Judd's sculpture in more than 30 years, Judd explores the work of a landmark artist who, over the course of his career, developed a material and formal vocabulary that transformed the field of modern sculpture. Donald Judd was among a generation of artists in the 1960s who sought to entirely do away with illusion, narrative and metaphorical content. He turned to three dimensions as well as industrial working methods and materials in order to investigate 'real space,' by his definition. Judd surveys the evolution of the artist's work, beginning with his paintings, reliefs and handmade objects from the early 1960s; through the years in which he built an iconic vocabulary of works in three dimensions, including hollow boxes, stacks and progressions made with metals and plastics by commercial fabricators and continuing through his extensive engagement with color during the last decade of his life. This richly illustrated catalog takes a close look at Judd's achievements, and, using newly available archival materials at the Judd Foundation and elsewhere, expands scholarly perspectives on his work. The essays address subjects such as his early beginnings in painting, the fabrication of his sculptures, his site-specific pieces and his work in design and architecture--

Title:  Electrical circuits  
Abstract: The triclinic phase of zinc molybdate alpha-ZnMoO4 (ZMO) was synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method at 600 degrees C. The crystal structure of the obtained polycrystalline sample of ZMO was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld calculations using the space group P-1. The electrical properties of alpha-ZnMoO4 compacted pellets were determined at room temperature from electrical impedance spectrometry (EIS), in the temperature range of 400-700 degrees C. Nyquist representations were interpreted in terms of two types of electrical circuits, involving a high frequency bulk component and a low frequency Warburg component. Analyses of the frequency dependence of the real and imaginary impedance show a non-Debye type relaxation. A phase transition corresponding to the allotropic transformation triclinic-monoclinic (alpha ->beta) of ZnMoO4 was observed in the temperature range of 450-500 degrees C, with a variation of activation energies. The Warburg component is discussed in terms of electrode surface reactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

Title: Eden`s outcasts
Abstract: The beloved author of Little Women was torn between pleasing her idealistic father and planting her feet in the material world. Now, Louisa May Alcott’s name is known universally; yet, during her youth, the famous Alcott was her father, Bronson--an eminent teacher, lecturer, and friend of Emerson and Thoreau. Willful and exuberant, Louisa flew in the face of all her father’s theories of child rearing. She, in turn, could not understand the frugal life Bronson preached, which reached its epitome in the failed utopian community of Fruitlands. In a family that insisted on self-denial and spiritual striving, Louisa dreamed of wealth and fame. At the same time, like most daughters, she wanted her father’s approval. This story of their tense yet loving relationship adds dimensions to Louisa’s life, her work, and the relationships of fathers and daughters.--From publisher description.

Title:  Headache  
Abstract: Studies have suggested a possible association of migraine and increased risk of ischemic stroke in young adults, particularly in smokers and in women who use oral contraceptive drugs. We aimed to analyze the association between migraine and ischemic stroke in young population in a hospital-based cohort. We included 202 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke who were between 15 and 50 years and age- and gender-matched 250 volunteers with no history of stroke. All participants were interviewed using a questionnaire for migraine. Localization of ischemic lesion was classified as anterior and posterior circulation according to neuroimaging findings. The cause of ischemic lesion and all risk factors were recorded. Undetermined etiology was the most frequent (43.1%) and the most common determined cause was cardioembolism (22.3%) in young stroke patients. Frequency of migraine was 30.2% among patients with stroke whereas 16.8% of healthy subjects had migraine (p = 0.001). Migraine with aura was significantly more common among patients with stroke compared to healthy subjects (18.3 vs 4.4%; p = 0.000) whereas the frequency of migraine without aura was similar in both groups (11.9 vs 12.4%). Using logistic regression, migraine with aura was shown to be an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke in young population (p = 0.000) and separate analysis for gender demonstrated that it was only a risk factor for women (p = 0.009) but not for men (p = 0.107). Migraine with aura was found to be more common in ischemic stroke in young patients. It was an independent risk factor in women.

Title:  Materials Engineering  
Abstract: We report on an experimental verification that emission properties of photocathodes can be manipulated through the engineering of the surface electronic structure. Ultrathin multilayered MgO/Ag(0 0 1)/MgO films were grown by pulsed laser deposition, tuning the thickness n of the flanking MgO layers to 0, 2, 3, and 4 monolayers. We observed an increase in quantum efficiency and simultaneous decrease in work function with layer thickness. The scale and trend direction of measurements are in good but not excellent agreement with theory. Angle resolved photoemission data for the multilayered sample n = 3 showed that the emission profile has a metallic-like momentum dispersion. Deviations from theoretical predictions [K. Nemeth et al., PRL 104, 046801 (2010)] are attributed to imperfections of real surfaces in contrast with the ideal surfaces of the calculation. Photoemissive properties of cathodes are critical for electron beam applications such as photoinjectors for Free Electron Lasers (FEL) and Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL). An ideal photoemitter has a high quantum efficiency, low work function, low intrinsic emittance and long lifetime. It has been demonstrated here that emission properties may be systematically tailored by control of layer thickness in ultrathin multilayered structures. The reproducibility of the emission parameters under specific growth conditions is excellent, even though the interfaces themselves have varying degrees of roughness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title:  Northern blotting  
Abstract: Pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) enzymes are responsible for the operation of ethanolic fermentation pathway that appears to correlate to an extent with anoxia tolerance in plants. This study was undertaken with the objective of (a) analysing the rice pdc gene family and (b) altering the efficacy of the ethanolic fermentation process, through production of transgenic rice plants over- and under-expressing pyruvate decarboxylase (employing Ospdc1 gene from rice) as well as over-expressing alcohol dehydrogenase (employing Ghadh2 gene from cotton) proteins. Correlations noted in this study between the pattern of expression of the Pdc alpha-subunit and Ospdc2 transcript as well as between the Pdc beta-subunit and Ospdc1 transcript suggest the possibility that alpha-subunit is encoded by Ospdc2 and that beta-subunit is encoded by Ospdc1. The fact that levels of Pdc beta-subunit were particularly high in pUH-sPdc1 (plasmid construct designed for over-expression of Ospdc1) seedlings while levels of beta-subunit levels were negligible or lower in pUH-asPdc1 (plasmid construct designed for under-expression of Ospdc1) seedlings also support these observations. Transgenics raised for over-expression of Pdc and Adh and under-expression of Pdc were confirmed for the transgene presence and effects by PCR, Southern blotting, Northern blotting, Western blotting and isozyme assays. Pdc and Adh over-expressing rice transgenics at early seedling stage under unstressed control growth conditions showed slight, consistent advantage in root vigour as compared to that of wild-type seedlings.

Title: The SAGE handbook of historical theory 
Abstract: The editors introduce the core areas of current debate within historical theory, bringing the reader as up to date with continuing debates and current developments as is possible. The book is divided into three parts, covering: Part I. Foundations: The Theoretical Grounds for Knowledge of the Past ; Part II. Applications: Theory-Intensive Areas in History ; Part III. Coda. Post-Postmodernism: Directions and Interrogations. This important handbook brings together in one volume discussions of the role of modernity, empiricism, realism, post-modernity and deconstruction in the historian's craft. Chapters are written by leading writers from around the world and cover a wide spread of historical sub-disciplines, such as social history, intellectual history, narrative, gender, memory, psycho-analysis and cultural studies, taking in, along the way, the work of thinkers such as Paul Ricouer, Michel Foucault and Hayden White. The Sage Handbook of Historical Theory is an essential resource for practicing historians, and students of history, and will appeal to scholars in related disciplines in the social sciences and humanities who seek a closer understanding of the theoretical foundations of history.--Publisher's website.

Title:  Headache  
Abstract: The melatonin as the pineal gland's secretory product is implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Melatonin has critical functions in human physiology, and research underscores the importance of melatonin in circadian rhythm, sleep, and mood regulation. Clinical observations have indicated that migraine attacks have a seasonal, menstrual, and circadian timing, suggesting that chronobiological mechanisms and their alterations may causally involve in the etiology of the disease. However, the topic has received relatively little attention in the migraine literature. Associations between melatonin, circadian preference, sleep, and mood states were investigated in the current study. Fifty-five patients (47 females and 8 males) were compared to 57 gender and age-matched control subjects (40 females and 17 males). A socio-demographical questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire were administered to volunteers. Blood samples were taken from all participants at about 1:00 AM in an unlit room not to hamper melatonin secretion, and blood melatonin levels were measured using quantitative ELISA test. In comparison with controls, melatonin levels were significantly lower among migraine patients. Migraineurs reported significantly greater scores on the BAI, confusion-bewilderment subscale of the POMS, and total and sleep latency subscale of the PSQI. Migraine patients who had nausea during the migraine attacks and who reported bouts relevant to certain food consumption, such as cheese or chocolate, had significantly lower levels of melatonin. Contrarily, groups did not reveal statistically substantial difference in circadian preferences.

Title:  Low Testosterone  
Abstract: Background: Multiple epidemiological studies have shown that low testosterone levels are associated with and predict the future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. The aim of our study was to show the influence of testosterone replacement therapy on obesity, HbA1c level, hypertension and dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes mellitus and androgen deficiency. Methods: One hundred and twenty-five male patients with diabetes mellitus were screened; 85 subjects aged 41 to 65 years, with BMI from 27.0 to 48.0 kg/m(2), were randomized in a placebo-controlled study. They also underwent a routine physical examination and selected by free testosterone examination. We divided patients into two groups: 1) treatment group, where we used diet, physical activity, patient's antidiabetic therapy and testosterone replacement therapy; 2) placebo group, where we used diet, physical activity, patient's antidiabetic therapy and placebo. Results: After 6 months of treatment we repeated the diagnostic assessments: lipid profile was improved in both groups but in first group it was clinically significant. Free testosterone level increased in all groups, but in group I was clinically significant. HbA1c decreased in both groups, but in group I we obtained the best result. Leptin level after treatment was approximately the same in both groups. Also, blood pressure was reduced in both groups but results were similar. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that it is possible to break this metabolic vicious circle by raising testosterone levels in diabetic men with androgen deficiency. Re-instituting physiological levels of testosterone, as the study has shown, has an important role in reducing the prevalence of diabetic complications.

Title:  Person perception  
Abstract: Across six studies, we examine how the magnitude of expressed happiness influences social perception and interpersonal behavior. We find that happiness evokes different judgments when expressed at high levels than when expressed at moderate levels, and that these judgments influence opportunistic behavior. Specifically, people perceive very happy individuals to be more naive than moderately happy individuals. These perceptions reflect the belief that very happy individuals shelter themselves from negative information about the world. As a result of these inferences, very happy people, relative to moderately happy people, are more likely to receive biased advice from advisors with a conflict of interest and are more likely to be chosen as negotiation partners when the opportunity for exploitation is salient. Our findings challenge existing assumptions in organizational behavior and psychology by identifying a significant disadvantage of expressing happiness, and underscore the importance of examining emotional expressions at different magnitudes. We call for future work to explore how the same emotion, experienced or expressed at different levels, influences judgment and behavior. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title:  Machine learning  
Abstract: Existing resource allocation approaches for nowadays stochastic networks are challenged to meet fast convergence and tolerable delay requirements. The present paper leverages online learning advances to facilitate online resource allocation tasks. By recognizing the central role of Lagrange multipliers, the underlying constrained optimization problem is formulated as a machine learning task involving both training and operational modes, with the goal of learning the sought multipliers in a fast and efficient manner. To this end, an order-optimal offline learning approach is developed first for batch training, and it is then generalized to the online setting with a procedure termed learn-and-adapt. The novel resource allocation protocol permeates benefits of stochastic approximation and statistical learning to obtain low-complexity online updates with learning errors close to the statistical accuracy limits, while still preserving adaptation performance, which in the stochastic network optimization context guarantees queue stability. Analysis and simulated tests demonstrate that the proposed data-driven approach improves the delay and convergence performance of existing resource allocation schemes.

Title: Thinking with the poem
Abstract: Broad-ranging and pluralistically investigative, the essays in Thinking with the Poem document Rachel Blau DuPlessis’s authorial interventions as a poet, scholar, and cultural critic steeped in the linguistic and political frames of her time. The writers included in this volume engage root-level questions at the heart of DuPlessis’s praxis as posed by her in a recent essay: What is a poem, what is a poet, what is an oeuvre, what is the 'poetic'? Inventive and noncanonical, these essays offer substantive responses to these and other questions, providing new routes of inquiry into the poetry and poetics of this preeminent figure of new writing--

Title:  PID controller  
Abstract: It is of great importance in many applications to provide a stable output power of a gyrotron-traveling wave tube (gyro-TWT) during a long operation time (over several hours). In order to achieve this goal, an automatic hot test platform of gyro-TWTs was set up and the power stabilization was obtained by an adaptive scheme of proportional integral derivative (PID) feedback by the beam current controlled by the filament heating power and cathode-anode beam voltage. With determined operating parameters, the PID controller can adaptively adjust the beam current and voltage, and then maintain the output power on a target. This PID controlling process can effectively eliminate the influence of the power supply voltage surge and cathode emission instability. Automatic hot test of the gyro-TWTs shows that the PID feedback controlling accuracy of the output power is better than 2%.

Title:  Electrical circuits  
Abstract: Evolvable Hardware (EHW) is hardware that can dynamically change its behavior and architecture by interacting with its environment. EHW can make use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to optimally synthesize electrical circuits. In this paper, five different mutation methods are implemented in a conventional genetic algorithm technique to automatically realize a digital 8 bit full adder (FA). The main achievement of this work is the comparison between those techniques in terms of number of iterations required to converge on the required logical structure. Results demonstrate that the sequential mutation method (SMM) and circular gene method (CGM) reduce the convergence time, and a substantial reduction is observed when these methods are combined with the Adaptive Group Mutation (AGM) method for the full adder implementation.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Title: Henry James and the art of impressions 
Abstract: Henry James criticized the impressionism which was revolutionizing French painting and French fiction, and satirized the British aesthetic movement, which championed impressionist criticism. Yet time and again he used the word 'impression' to represent the most intense moments of consciousness of his characters, as well as the work of the literary artist. Henry James and the Art of Impressions argues that the literary art of the impression, as James practised it, places his work within the wider cultural history of impressionism, and means that his work stands outside that history and challenges its very terms. 0'Henry James and the Art of Impressions' offers an unprecedentedly detailed cultural and intellectual history of the impression. It draws on philosophy, psychology, literature, critical theory, and the visual arts to study James's early art criticism, literary criticism, travel writing, prefaces, and the three great novels of his major phase,The Ambassadors,The Wings of the Dove, and The Golden Bowl. It argues that coherent philosophical meanings of the Jamesian impression emerge when they are comprehended as a family of related ideas about perception, imagination, and aesthetics - bound together by James's attempt to reconcile the novel's value as a mimetic form with its value as a transformative creative activity. 0'Henry James and the Art of Impressions' traces the development of the impression across a range of disciplines to show the cultural and intellectual debts James's use of the word owes them. It offers a more philosophical account of James to complement the more historicist work of recent decades.

Title: Postwertzeichendesign
Abstract: The world's first official postage stamp was issued in May 1840: the legendary 'One Penny Black' with the profile of the Queen of England. The new payment system in the field of logistics by Sir Rowland Hill quickly gained hold all around the world. For the first time, this publication discusses the significance and functions of postage stamps as prominently visible elements of communication design. The expressiveness inherent in the small-sized images and the very peculiar and heterogeneous image vocabulary of this medium of mass culture is analyzed based on more than 40 designs by Hans G

Title:  Signal-flow graph  
Abstract: In this paper, a parallel coupled optical ring resonator filter is studied and the transfer function is derived using the signal flow graph (SFG) approach to identify the filter performance in terms of crosstalk suppression bandwidth and signal integrity. This paper proposes the use of the SFG (Mason's rule) approach to determine the filtering characteristics of parallel coupled ring resonators. A commercial electromagnetic simulator is used to validate the analytical model. The modeling of the parallel coupled ring resonator covers the analysis of the out-of-band rejection ratio, crosstalk suppression, loss effect, and the effect of coupling coefficients on the crosstalk bandwidth. The good agreement between analytical model results and simulation results suggests that using the derived analytical model provides an accurate starting point for design and analysis and, in doing this, provides a better insight into the signal integrity performance of the filter.

Title:  Human Metabolism  
Abstract: Context: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inactivates the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide. It can also affect the orexigenic hormone neuropeptide Y (NPY(1-36)) which is truncated by DPP-IV to NPY(3-36), as a consequence NPY's affinity changes from receptor Y1, which mediates the antilipolytic function of NPY, to other NPY receptors. Little is known whether DPP-IV inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients could influence these pathways. Aims: To investigate the in vitro effects of NPY with DPP-IV inhibition in isolated abdominal subcutaneous (AbdSc) adipocytes on fat metabolism, and assessment of NPY receptor and DPP-IV expression in adipose tissue (AT). Methods: Ex vivo human AT was taken from women undergoing elective surgery (body mass index: 27.5 (mean +/- s.d.) +/- 5 kg/m(2), age: 43.7 +/- 10 years, n = 36). Isolated AbdSc adipocytes were treated with human recombinant (rh)NPY (1-100 nM) with and without DPP-IV inhibitor (1 M); glycerol release and tissue distribution of DPP-IV, Y1 and Y5 messenger RNA (mRNA) were measured and compared between lean and obese subjects. Results and conclusion: rhNPY reduced glycerol release, an effect that was further enhanced by co-incubation with a DPP-IV inhibitor [control: 224 (mean +/- s.e.) +/- 37 mu mol/l; NPY, 100 nM: 161 +/- 27 mmol/l**; NPY 100 nM/DPP-IV inhibitor, 1 M: 127 +/- 14 mu mol/l**; **p < 0.01, n = 14]. DPP-IV was expressed in AbdSc AT and omental AT with relative DPP-IV mRNA expression lower in AbdSc AT taken from obese [77 +/- 6 signal units (SU)] vs. lean subjects (186 +/- 29 SU*, n = 10). Y1 was predominantly expressed in fat and present in all fat depots but higher in obese subjects, particularly the AbdSc AT-depot (obese: 1944 +/- 111 SU vs. lean: 711 +/- 112 SU**, n = 10). NPY appears to be regulated by AT-derived DPP-IV. DPP-IV inhibitors augment the antilipolytic effect of NPY in AT. Further studies are required to show whether this explains the lack of weight loss in T2DM patients treated with DPP-IV inhibitors.

Title: In search of a moral foundation for capitalism
Abstract: The search for a moral foundation for capitalism has a long history that continues to unfold, yet many are unaware of this search or its implications for the future of capitalism. The recent pandemic has uncovered cracks in the foundation of capitalism and raised doubts regarding its ability to meet the broader needs of society. In Search of a Moral Foundation for Capitalism explains the continuing demand for a moral foundation from the perspective of business leaders, business educators, and policymakers, and tells the story of the search for that moral foundation through its leading characters. By presenting the life stories and writings of these leading characters - from Adam Smith to Amartya Sen - this book reveals the rich moral critique provided by these great thinkers and explains how that rich critique was lost through the influence of the Chicago School and its emphasis on self-interest. --

Title: Bring the funny
Abstract: A sharp, funny book about comedy screenwriting from a successful screenwriter that uses recent - as in this century - movies you've actually seen as examples. Greg DePaul (Screenwriter, Bride Wars, Saving Silverman) has sold scripts to Miramax, Fox, Disney, New Line, Sony, MGM and Village Roadshow. He's worked with comedy stars like Jack Black, Kate Hudson, Jason Biggs and Amanda Peet. Now Greg takes everything he knows about writing comedy and breaking into the biz, tosses it into a blender and serves up this tasty, fat-free smoothie of a book that's easy to read, brutally honest, and straight from the heart ... of Hollywood.

Title: The invisible history of the human race
Abstract: How biology, psychology, and history shape us as individuals We are doomed to repeat history if we fail to learn from it, but how are we affected by the forces that are invisible to us? In The Invisible History of the Human Race Christine Kenneally draws on cutting-edge research to reveal how both historical artifacts and DNA tell us where we come from and where we may be going. While some books explore our genetic inheritance and popular television shows celebrate ancestry, this is the first book to explore how everything from DNA to emotions to names and the stories that form our lives are all part of our human legacy. Kenneally shows how trust is inherited in Africa, silence is passed down in Tasmania, and how the history of nations is written in our DNA. From fateful, ancient encounters to modern mass migrations and medical diagnoses, Kenneally explains how the forces that shaped the history of the world ultimately shape each human who inhabits it--Provided by publisher.

Title: Research methods for social work 
Abstract: If you're intimidated by the thought of taking research methods, Rubin and Babbie's classic bestseller can help you overcome the fear factor often associated with this course with its reader-friendly presentation of all aspects of the research endeavor. If you're not intimidated, you'll still appreciate the authors' clear and often humorous writing style as well as the book's depth and breadth of coverage. RESEARCH METHODS FOR SOCIAL WORK, Ninth Edition, strikes an optimal balance of quantitative and qualitative research techniques -- illustrating how the two methods complement one another and can be integrated in the same study. Relevant examples from real-world settings highlight the connections between research and social work practice. Comprehensive, friendly, accurate, and integrating the best of technology, this text is widely considered the best text for the research methods course -- and when you read it, you'll see why.

Title: Poetry, modernism, and an imperfect world 
Abstract: Diverse modernist poems, far from advertising a capacity to prefigure utopia or save society, understand themselves to be complicit in the unhappiness and injustice of an imperfect or fallen world. Combining analysis of technical devices and aesthetic values with broader accounts of contemporary critical debates, social contexts, and political history, this book offers a formalist argument about how these poems understand themselves and their situation, and a historicist argument about the meanings of their forms. The poetry of the canonical modernists T. S. Eliot, Mina Loy, and Wallace Stevens is placed alongside the poetry of Ford Madox Ford, better known for his novels and his criticism, and the poetry of Joseph Macleod, whose work has been largely forgotten. Focusing on the years from 1914 to 1930, the book offers a new account of a crucial moment in the history of British and American modernism.

Title: The China development model
Abstract: Over the last thirty years, China has been reforming its economy at breakneck speed. In China, as in every country, the time of reformation is a crucial one. Although China's growth model is likely to be very effective in coping with today's economic requirements, the reform policy implemented by China's leaders is facing increased opposition from both within the Party as well as from society as a whole. A surge in nationalism is threatening China's relations with its neighbours and its rise to regional leadership. In the aftermath of the worldwide financial crisis, China has emerged as the second largest economy soon to overtake the USA, but the crisis has also emphasized the reliance of China's economy on the developed market and the subsequent decreasing growth rate. The Chinese growth model is now reaching to the core of the system i.e. the social and political institutions. This book addresses a wide range of factors influencing the development of China's model and its influence on the rest of the world. --

Title: The culture of contentment 
Abstract: The world has become increasingly separated into the haves and have-nots. In The Culture of Contentment, renowned economist John Kenneth Galbraith shows how a contented class--not the privileged few but the socially and economically advantaged majority--defend their comfortable status at a cost. Middle-class voting against regulation and increased taxation that would remedy pressing social ills has created a culture of immediate gratification, leading to complacency and hampering long-term progress. Only economic disaster, military action, or the eruption of an angry underclass seem capable of changing the status quo. A groundbreaking critique, The Culture of Contentment shows how the complacent majority captures the political process and determines economic policy.

Title:  PID controller  
Abstract: This article presents a novel hybrid optimization approach for a nonlinear controller of a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM). The DSTATCOM is connected to a distribution system with the distributed generation units. The nonlinear control is based on partial feedback linearization. Two proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers regulate the voltage and track the output in this control system. In the conventional scheme, the trial-and-error method is used to determine the PID controller coefficients. This article uses a combination of a fuzzy system, simulated annealing (SA) and intelligent water drops (IWD) algorithms to optimize the parameters of the controllers. The obtained results reveal that the response of the optimized controlled system is effectively improved by finding a high-quality solution. The results confirm that using the tuning method based on the fuzzy-SA-IWD can significantly decrease the settling and rising times, the maximum overshoot and the steady-state error of the voltage step response of the DSTATCOM. The proposed hybrid tuning method for the partial feedback linearizing (PFL) controller achieved better regulation of the direct current voltage for the capacitor within the DSTATCOM. Furthermore, in the event of a fault the proposed controller tuned by the fuzzy-SA-IWD method showed better performance than the conventional controller or the PFL controller without optimization by the fuzzy-SA-IWD method with regard to both fault duration and clearing times.

Title: Felony and the guilty mind in medieval England 
Abstract: This book explores the role of mens rea, broadly defined as a factor in jury assessments of guilt and innocence from the early thirteenth through the fourteenth century - the first two centuries of the English criminal trial jury. Drawing upon evidence from the plea rolls, but also relying heavily upon non-legal textual sources such as popular literature and guides for confessors, Elizabeth Papp Kamali argues that issues of mind were central to jurors' determinations of whether a particular defendant should be convicted, pardoned, or acquitted outright. Demonstrating that the word 'felony' itself connoted a guilty state of mind, she explores the interplay between social conceptions of guilt and innocence and jury behavior. Furthermore, she reveals a medieval understanding of felony that involved, in its paradigmatic form, three essential elements: an act that was reasoned, was willed in a way not constrained by necessity, and was evil or wicked in its essence.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

Title:  Prejudice  
Abstract: Although a lot of research attention has already been devoted to the personality and emotional basis of right-wing attitudes and racial prejudice, the relationships between trait Emotional Intelligence (El) and the latter variables have been largely neglected. In the present study conducted in a heterogeneous sample of adults (N = 419), we aim to fill this gap in the literature. It was revealed that trait El is negatively related to Right-Wing Authoritarianism, Social Dominance Orientation, and subtle racial prejudice. These relationships can be partly explained by empathy, and more specifically the component of perspective taking. Trait El is negatively related to the ability to take the perspective of others, which in turn is associated with increased right-wing attitudes and subtle racial prejudice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title:  Computer graphics  
Abstract: Providing optimal mechanical ventilation to critically-ill children remains a challenge. Patient-ventilator dyssynchrony results frequently with numerous deleterious consequences on patient outcome including increased requirement for sedation, prolonged duration of ventilation, and greater imposed work of breathing. Most currently used ventilators have real-time, continuously-displayed graphics of pressure, volume, and flow versus time (scalars) as well as pressure, and flow versus volume (loops). A clear understanding of these graphics provides a lot of information about the mechanics of the respiratory system and the patient ventilator interaction in a dynamic fashion. Using this information will facilitate tailoring the support provided and the manner in which it is provided to best suit the dynamic needs of the patient. This paper starts with a description of the scalars and loops followed by a discussion of the information that can be obtained from each of these graphics. A review will follow, on the common types of dyssynchronous interactions and how each of these can be detected on the ventilator graphics. The final section discusses how graphics can be used to optimize the ventilator support provided to patients.

Title:  Operating systems  
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for the development of sensor node software for various operating systems in a sensor network environment. The proposed development framework consists of attributes, code templates and development support tool. Sensor node software is developed, based on the framework through four steps - sensor network modeling, PIM design, PSM design and code generation. Accordingly, this paper presents the methods for attributes design, code templates design, PIM-to-PSM mapping, and source code generation. Through the proposed technique, reusability of sensor network software will be increased since models, attributes and code templates can be reused for various operating systems through the framework. Productivity of software development will be increased, because software design is easily performed using attributes and software codes for all nodes in the sensor network can be generated at once from a model. Also, expandability of sensor network software will be increased, since new functions of existing operating systems or new operating systems can be added through the framework and sensor network software can be rebuilt by applying the added functions or operating systems.

Title: China-art-modernity
Abstract: China―Art―Modernity provides a critical introduction to modern and contemporary Chinese art as a whole. It illuminates what is distinctive and significant about the rich range of art created during the tumultuous period of Chinese history from the end of Imperial rule to the present day. The story of Chinese art in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries is shown to be deeply intertwined with that of the country’s broader socio-political development, with art serving both as a tool for the creation of a new national culture and as a means for critiquing the forms that culture has taken. The book’s approach is inclusive. In addition to treating art within the Chinese Mainland itself during the Republican and Communist eras, for instance, it also looks at the art of colonial Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese diaspora. Similarly, it gives equal prominence to artists employing tools and idioms of indigenous Chinese origin and those who engage with international styles and contemporary media. In this way it writes China into the global story of modern art as a whole at a moment in intellectual history when Western-centred stories of modern and contemporary culture are finally being recognized as parochial and inadequate. Assuming no previous background knowledge of Chinese history and culture, this concise yet comprehensive and richly-illustrated book will appeal to those who already have an established interest in modern Chinese art and those for whom this is a novel topic. It will be of particular value to students of Chinese art or modern art in general, but it is also for those in the wider reading public with a curiosity about modern China. At a time when that country has become a major actor on the world stage in all sorts of ways, accessible sources of information concerning its modern visual culture are nevertheless surprisingly scarce. As a consequence, a fully nuanced picture of China’s place in the modern world remains elusive. China―Art―Modernity is a timely remedy for that situation.

Title: European public spheres
Abstract: The euro crisis has led to an unprecedented Europeanization and politicization of public spheres across the continent. In this volume, leading scholars make two claims. First, they suggest that transnational cross-border communication in Europe has been encouraged through the gradual Europeanization of national as well as issue-specific public spheres. Second, the politicization of European affairs - at the European Union (EU) level and in the domestic politics of member states - is inevitable and here to stay. Europeanized public spheres, whether elite media, mass media, or social media such as the internet, provide the arenas in which the politicization of European and EU issues takes place. European Public Spheres explores the history of these developments, the nature of politicization in the public spheres as well as its likely consequences, and the normative implications for European public life--

Title: Another world
Abstract: The remarkable story of the stylistic, cultural, and technical innovations that drove the surge of comics, caricature, and other print media in 19th-century Europe. Taking its title from the 1844 visionary graphic novel by J. J. Grandville, this groundbreaking book explores the invention of print media-including comics, caricature, the illustrated press, illustrated books, and popular prints-tracing their development as well as the aesthetic, political, technological, and cultural issues that shaped them. The explosion of imagery from the late 18th century to the beginning of the 20th exceeded the print production from all previous centuries combined, spurred the growth of the international art market, and encouraged the cross-fertilization of media, subjects, and styles. Patricia Mainardi examines scores of imaginative and innovative prints, focusing on highly experimental moments of discovery, when artists and publishers tested the limits of each new medium, creating visual languages that extend to the comics and graphic novels of today. Another World unearths a wealth of visual material, revealing a history of how our image-saturated world came into being, and situating the study of print culture firmly within the context of art history.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

Title: Reflexivization
Abstract: This title, first published in 1985, is the result of a cross-linguistic, comparative study of reflexives, with a major role played by syntactic conditions on reflexivization rules. The basic definitions outlined in the book lead to a discussion of morphological types, discussions about syntax, and speculations on the historical origins and destinies of the various kinds of reflexives. This title will be of interest to students of language and linguistics.

Title: The eternal frontier
Abstract: In The Eternal Frontier, world-renowned scientist and historian Tim Flannery tells the unforgettable story of the geological and biological evolution of the North American continent, from the time of the asteroid strike that ended the age of dinosaurs 65 million years ago, to the present day. Flannery describes the development of North America's deciduous forests and other flora, and tracks the immigration and emigration of various animals to and from Europe, Asia, and South America, showing how plant and animal species have either adapted or become extinct. The story takes in the massive changes wrought by the ice ages and the coming of the Indians, and continues right up to the present, covering the deforestation of the Northeast, the decimation of the buffalo, and other facets of the enormous impact of frontier settlement and the development of the industrial might of the United States. Natural history on a monumental scale, The Eternal Frontier contains an enormous wealth of fascinating scientific details, and Flannery's accessible and dynamic writing makes the book a delight to read. This is science writing at its very best -- a riveting page-turner that is simultaneously an accessible and scholarly trove of incredible information that is already being hailed by critics as a classic. Tim Flannery's account ... will fascinate Americans and non-Americans alike. -- Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs, and Steel No one before Flannery ... has been brave enough to tackle the whole pageant of North America. -- David Quammen, the New York Times Book Review Tim Flannery's book will forever change your perspective on the North American continent ... Exhilarating. -- John Terborgh, The New York Review of Books Full of engaging and attention-catching information about North America's geology, climate, and paleontology. -- Patricia Nelson Limerick, the Washington Post Book World Natural histor

Title:  Irritable Bowel Syndrome  
Abstract: Background/Aims Somatization may influence persistence and severity of symptoms in gastrointestinal diseases. Some studies suggest that somatization is associated with chronic uninvestigated dyspepsia (CUD); however, the association is unclear. We aimed to determine the association between the profiles of somatic complaints with CUD and its symptoms. Methods In a cross-sectional study conducted on 4763 Iranian adults, somatic complaints were assessed using a comprehensive 31-items questionnaire. Patients with CUD were identified by the Rome III diagnostic criteria. Profiles of somatic complaints were derived from factor analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between extracted profiles with CUD and its symptoms. Results CUD, bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiation, and epigastric pain or burning was identified in 723 (15.2%), 384 (8.1%), 302 (6.3%), and 371 (7.8%) of the study population. The frequency of all 31 somatic complaints was significantly higher in patients with CUD compared with controls (P < 0.001), and the most frequent was severe fatigue (45.1%). The profiles of somatic complaints were extracted in 4 domains, including ""psychological"", ""gastrointestinal"", ""neuro-skeletal"", and ""pharyngeal-respiratory"". The psychological (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.44-1.54), gastrointestinal (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 2.09-2.37), neuro-skeletal (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.44-1.59), and pharyngeal-respiratory (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.94-2.25) profiles were significantly associated with greater odds of CUD. Conclusions CUD and its symptoms are strongly associated with higher levels of somatic complaints and their related extracted profiles. This perhaps explains that why it can be difficult to treat, however further prospective investigations are required to confirm these associations.

Title: Big breasts & wide hips
Abstract: In a country where patriarchal favoritism and the primacy of sons survived multiple revolutions and an ideological earthquake, this epic novel is first and foremost about women. As the title implies, the female body serves as the book's most important image and metaphor. The protagonist, Mother, is born in 1900. Married at seventeen into the Shangguan family, she has nine children, none by her husband, who is sterile. The youngest is her only boy, the narrator of the book, a spoiled and ineffectual child who stands in stark contrast to his headstrong and forceful sisters. Mother, a survivor, is the quintessential strong woman, constantly risking her life to save several of her children and grandchildren as the political tides shift dramatically from year to year. ... Each of the seven chapters recounts a different era, from the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 through the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and the early years of Sun Yat Sen's Republic, the Japanese invasion in the 1930s, the civil war, the Cultural Revolution, and the post-Mao years--P.

Title:  Alzheimer's Disease  
Abstract: AimsThe main purpose was to verify the potent capacity of Neurotropin (R) against neuronal damage in hippocampus and to explore its underlying mechanisms. MethodsHT22 cells were treated with 40mol/L A(25-35) in the presence of various concentrations of Neurotropin (R) or in its absence. The cell viability was assessed with a CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry was used to measure cell apoptosis, intracellular ROS levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential. A plaques were examined by Bielschowsky silver staining, and the activities of antioxidants were detected in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after Neurotropin (R) treatment. The expression of proteins, including HIF-1, Bcl-2, Bax, and MAPKs signaling molecules was evaluated by Western blot. ResultsNeurotropin (R) significantly reversed the cell injury induced by A(25-35) through increasing cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, decreasing intracellular ROS and cell apoptosis of HT22 cells (P<.05). Furthermore, Neurotropin (R) markedly reduced the formation of A plaques and upregulated the activities of antioxidants (P<.05). Additionally, the protein expression of HIF-1, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and p-P38 was significantly inhibited in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. ConclusionsNeurotropin (R) exhibited a potent neuroprotective effect on inhibiting A-induced oxidative damage and alleviating A deposition in hippocampus via modulation of HIF-1/MAPK signaling pathway.

Title:  Migraine  
Abstract: BackgroundThere are limited literature data on migraine-like accompanying features (MLF) in patients with cluster headache (CH). These symptoms are frequently reported by patients and may delay CH diagnosis. ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of migraine-like symptoms in an Italian case series of CH patients and to determine whether these features influence the clinical phenotype of CH. MethodsA cross-sectional study was performed in all consecutive patients referred to the Parma Headache Centre between 1975 and 2013 affected by CH; the cases were subsequently reviewed applying the ICHD3-beta criteria. Our initial study sample consisted of 785 subjects, 569 men (72.5%) and 216 women (27.5%). We then identified those patients who reported at least one of the migraine accompanying symptoms (ie, nausea or vomiting or photophobia and phonophobia). ResultsWe found 362 patients (46%) with MLF, 250 men (43.9% of the initial male sample) and 112 women (51.9% of the initial female sample), and 423 patients (54%) without MLF, 319 men (56.1% of the initial male sample) and 104 women (48.1% of the initial female sample). Multiple logistic regression analysis highlighted some demographic and clinical features that significantly characterized patients with MLF after adjusting for confounding: they were more frequently female (OR 1.78, CI 1.11-2.80), with a relatively younger age of onset (OR 1.82, CI 1.06-2.91) than expected, attacks were longer in duration (OR 1.85, CI 1.04-2.46) and accompanied by a more frequent ptosis (OR 1.67, CI 1.04-2.34), sweating (OR 1.63, CI 1.02-2.21), and miosis (OR 1.54, CI 1.12-1.93); osmophobia was also more frequently reported (OR 1.76, CI 1.28-2.46). ConclusionOur study confirms the high proportion of CH patients with MLF, which is reported in literature. The presence of MLF seems to relate to some peculiar demographic and clinical characteristics of CH sufferers. Whether these features influence the response to therapy remains to be determined.

Title:  Cryptography  
Abstract: Point compression is an essential technique to save bandwidth and memory when deploying elliptic curve based security solutions in wireless communication systems. In this contribution, we provide new linear algebra (LA) based compression algorithms for multiple points on elliptic curves, that are compression algorithms which only make use of LA (with a constant number of field multiplications and at most one inversion, with no quadratic or higher degree polynomial root finding). In particular, we extend the results of Khabbazian et al. (IEEE Trans Comput 56(3):305-313, 2007) to four (resp. five) points on elliptic curves by generically storing five (resp. six) field elements and provide an asymptotic generalization to any number n of points on a curve by generically storing values.

Title: Econometrics in a formal science of economics
Abstract: Econometrics is a study of good and bad ways to measure economic relations. In this book, Bernt Stigum considers the role that economic theory ought to play in such measurements and proposes a formal science of economics that provides the means to solve the measurement problems faced by econometric researchers. After describing the salient parts of a formal science of economics, Stigum compares its methods with the methods of contemporary applied econometrics. His goal is to develop a basis for meaningful discussion of the best way to incorporate economic theory in empirical analysis.

Title:  Mental Health  
Abstract: Accessible Summary In England and Wales, some people with learning disabilities may have to be detained under the Mental Health Act 2007 as patients in a hospital for a period of assessment and or treatment if they are suffering from a mental disorder, and it is for the interests of their own health and safety, or to protect others. Patients who are detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2007 can apply to the Mental Health Tribunal to decide whether they should be detained in a psychiatric hospital or be discharged. The Mental Health Tribunal has the power to discharge these patients after a hearing. Patients who lack capacity to apply to the tribunal are unable to have a tribunal hearing. The European Court has ruled that this is unfair to these patients. There needs to be a system in place to ensure that these patients get a tribunal hearing. Abstract Background In the UK, the Mental Health Tribunal is a long-established safeguard for patients detained under the Mental Health Act. This gives such patients an effective appeal mechanism to ensure legal protection of their liberty. This act contains sections that allow for civil detention in the case of mental disorder. The right to apply to the tribunal against such detention is underpinned by the right to liberty under Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Some patients with learning disabilities may lack capacity and the ability to challenge their detention. Method This article presents a case study of a woman with Down's syndrome and severe learning disabilities. Whilst this woman was detained under the Mental Health Act, she could have applied for a review of her detention to the Mental Health Tribunal within 14days. She did not do so because she lacked capacity to instruct solicitors. Subsequently, as a result of appeal, the case proceeded through English and European judicial review. Results The European Court of Human Rights, in the case of MH v UK (2013), has ruled that the appeals procedure for patients without capacity detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act is not compatible with Article 5(4) of the European Convention of Human Rights. The European Court has ruled that special procedural safeguards are required to enable this cohort of patients to exercise their rights guaranteed by Article 5(4). Conclusions Responsible clinicians [treating consultant psychiatrists] need to ensure that all patients detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act have an assessment of their capacity to apply to the tribunal. There need to be systems in place to alert hospital managers when a patient lacks capacity to apply for a tribunal. Hospital managers should request the Secretary of State to apply for a tribunal in these instances. Knowledge of this ruling is relevant to informing the practice of other interdisciplinary healthcare professionals working with such patients.

Title:  PID controller  
Abstract: Fractional order PID (FOPID) controllers are introducedas a general form of classical PID controllers using fractional calculus. As this controller provides good disturbance rejection and is robust against plant uncertainties it is appropriate for the vibration mitigation in structures. In this paper, an FOPID controller is designed to adjust the contact force of piezoelectric friction dampers for semi-active control of base isolated structures during far-field and near-field earthquake excitations. A multi-objective cuckoo search algorithm is employed to tune the controller parameters. Considering the resulting Pareto optimal front, the best input for the FOPID controller is selected. For seven pairs of earthquakes and nine performance indices, the performance of the proposed controller is compared with those provided by several wellknown control techniques. According to the simulation results, the proposed controller performs better than other controllers in terms of simultaneous reduction of the maximum base displacement and story acceleration for various types of earthquakes. Also, it provides acceptable responses in terms of inter story drifts, root mean square of base displacements and floor acceleration. In addition, the evaluation of robustness for a stiffness uncertainty of 10% indicates that the proposed controller gives a robust performance against such modeling errors. (C) 2017 ISA.

Title:  Person perception  
Abstract: Introduction: Research has reported that smiles facilitate social relationships. However, the effect of a smile on driving behavior has received less interest. Method: This study attempts to evaluate how a pedestrian's smile influences an oncoming driver's behavior. In the first part of our study, male and female research assistants waiting at several pedestrian crossings were asked to smile or not at oncoming drivers. Results: It was found that a smile increases the number of drivers who stop. The same effect was observed when the pedestrian tries to cross outside the pedestrian crossing. Finally, this study shows that motorists drive slower after they see a pedestrian smile, suggesting that a smile can induce a positive mood. Practical Applications: This leads to motorists stopping more readily and driving more carefully. These results also suggest that pedestrians may increase their own safety by using appropriate nonverbal signals toward drivers. (C) 2015 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

Title:  Water Pollution  
Abstract: It is well known that Japan has successfully dealt with severe water pollution that was caused during its rapid economic growth. The lessons learned by Japan, the technological developments that emerged and the policy measures Japan devised to cope with its pollution are shared widely with Asian countries that now face severe water pollution associated with economic growth. However, this information has been basically qualitative in nature. In this paper we discuss the potential of using patent data and perform analyses to substantiate the insights such data can yield in order to provide more quantitative information on historical trends in the development of essential technologies in this field. Specifically, we demonstrate an approach using patent data to verify the historical development of wastewater and sewage sludge treatment technologies over the past 50 years in Japan. We examined relevant patent data from 1961 onward and addressed technological development trends in relation to societal changes and the implementation of governmental policies during that period. As an example of the substantiating analysis, we applied principal component analysis and text mining to review the trends in a systematic manner. We demonstrate that the emergence of such developments can be closely associated with societal background factors such as the adoption of relevant governmental policies. We argue that this kind of patent data analysis, coupled with other essential data, can yield clues to the evolution of relevant technologies in the past, leading to useful implications for environmental management of economically developing nations.

Title:  Algorithm design  
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for a strapdown Inertial Navigation System (INS) algorithm design by using Lie group and Lie algebra. The general way to solve Lie group differential equations is introduced. Investigations reveal that this general Lie group method provides a simpler unified way to solve differential equations involving direction cosine matrix, quaternion and dual quaternion, which are widely used in INS algorithm design. Furthermore, we also present a new INS algorithm based on the Special Euclidean group SE(3) under the guidelines of Lie group method. Analyses show that SE(3) algorithm has the same accuracy as a dual quaternion algorithm, this is also justified by numerical simulations. Though the SE(3) algorithm has no improvements in accuracy, the general Lie group method used in the design process shows its brevity and uniformity.

Title: The Oxford handbook of Thucydides 
Abstract: The Oxford Handbook of Thucydides contains newly commissioned essays on Thucydides as an historian, thinker, and writer. It also features chapters on Thucydides' intellectual context and ancient reception. The creative juxtaposition of historical, literary, philosophical, and reception studies allows for a better grasp of Thucydides' complex project and its intellectual context, while at the same time providing a comprehensive introduction to the author's ideas. The volume is organized into four sections of papers: History, Historiography, Political Theory, and Context and Reception. It therefore bridges traditionally divided disciplines. The authors engaged to write the forty chapters for this volume include both well-known scholars and less well-known innovators, who bring fresh ideas and new points of view. Articles avoid technical jargon and long footnotes, and are written in an accessible style. Finally, the volume includes a thorough introduction prefacing each paper, as well as several maps and an up-to-date bibliography that will enable further study. The Oxford Handbook of Thucydides offers a comprehensive introduction to a thinker and writer whose simultaneous depth and innovativeness have been the focus of intense literary and philosophical study since ancient times.

Title:  Child abuse  
Abstract: This study examined the patterns and correlates of the types of maltreatment experienced by adolescents aged 9-12, participating in an ongoing longitudinal study on the impact of neglect on children's development. Using case record abstraction, the study compared the child protection classification and findings from the case record abstraction with regard to the rates of four types of maltreatment (i.e. physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect) as well as co-occurrence across multiple types of maltreatment. Next, the study examined the frequently observed patterns of child maltreatment. Finally, the study investigated whether aspects of caretaker functioning and the detailed incident characteristics in the cases of neglect differed by the number of different types of maltreatment the children experienced. Results showed significant discrepancies between the Child Protective Service classification and case record abstraction. Child Protective Service classification considerably underestimated the rate of co-occurrence across multiple types of maltreatment. Neglect accompanied by physical and emotional abuse was the most common form. Some of the caretaker functioning variables distinguished the number of types of maltreatment. Based on the findings, future-research directions and practice implication were discussed.

Title: The dracula dilemma
Abstract: For many in the West, Romania is synonymous with Count Dracula. Since the publication of Bram Stoker's famous novel in 1897 Transylvania (and by extension, Romania) has become inseparable in the Western imagination with Dracula, vampires and the supernatural. Moreover, since the late 1960s Western tourists have travelled to Transylvania on their own searches for the literary and supernatural roots of the Dracula myth. Such 'Dracula tourism' presents Romania with a dilemma. On one hand, Dracula is Romania's unique selling point and has considerable potential to be exploited for economic gain. On the other hand, the whole notion of vampires and the supernatural is starkly at odds with Romania's self-image as a modern, developed, European state. This book examines the way that Romania has negotiated Dracula tourism over the past four decades. During the communist period (up to 1989) the Romanian state did almost nothing to encourage such tourism but reluctantly tolerated it. However, some discrete local initiatives were developed to cater for Dracula enthusiasts that operated at the margins of legality in a communist state. In the post-communist period (after 1989) any attempt to censor Dracula has disappeared and the private sector in Romania has been swift to exploit the commercial possibilities of the Count. However, the Romanian state remains ambivalent about Dracula and continues to be reluctant to encourage or promote Dracula tourism. As such Romania's dilemma with Dracula remains unresolved.

Title:  Irritable Bowel Syndrome  
Abstract: The relationship between the conscious experience of physical symptoms and indicators of objective physiological dysfunction is highly variable and depends on characteristics of the person, the context and their interaction. This relationship often breaks down entirely in the case of ""medically unexplained"" or functional somatic symptoms, violating the basic assumption in medicine that physical symptoms have physiological causes. In this paper, we describe the prevailing theoretical approach to this problem and review the evidence pertaining to it. We then use the framework of predictive coding to propose a new and more comprehensive model of the body-symptom relationship that integrates existing concepts within a unifying framework that addresses many of the shortcomings of current theory. We describe the conditions under which a close correspondence between the experience of symptoms and objective physiology might be expected, and when they are likely to diverge. We conclude by exploring some theoretical and clinical implications of this new account. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: FinTech
Abstract: Everything that we know about the world of finance is changing before us. Innovation is happening constantly, despite the protests of the traditional financial industry. With all the new technology that we have today, it is almost mind-blowing to think about the kind of technology that we will have in another ten years or so. The change is going to keep coming, the only thing we can do is get on board with it. This book introduces the basics of FinTech and equips readers with the knowledge to get on the cutting edge of age we live in today.

Title: Darwin's most wonderful plants
Abstract: Most of us think of Darwin at work on The Beagle, taking inspiration for his theory of evolution from his travels in the Galapagos. But Darwin published his Origin of Species nearly thirty years after his voyages and most of his labours in that time were focused on experimenting with and observing plants at his house in Kent. He was particularly interested in carnivorous and climbing plants, and in pollination and the evolution of flowers. Ken Thompson sees Darwin as a brilliant and revolutionary botanist, whose observations and theories were far ahead of his time - and are often only now being confirmed and extended by high-tech modern research. Like Darwin, he is fascinated and amazed by the powers of plants - particularly their Triffid-like aspects of movement, hunting and 'plant intelligence'.--Publisher's description.

Title:  Osteoarthritis  
Abstract: Advances in the knowledge of acromegaly are leading to an increase in the survival rate of acromegalic subjects. This study was conducted to evaluate balance control, risk of falls, and peripheral muscle function in acromegalic older adults. Seventeen older subjects with acromegaly (67 [63-73] years) and 20 paired control subjects were evaluated with balance scales, force platform, and knee isokinetic dynamometry tests. There were significant differences between the groups on several balance and gait scales, with a worse performance and greater risk of falls in the acromegalic older adults. Acromegalic older adults had lower values for peak torque, maximum repetition of the total work, and total work during extension at 240 degrees/s. The acromegalic older adults had higher values in the medial-lateral range. Acromegaly subjects had lateral instability that compromises their body balance and increases the risk of falls. Moreover, there was a propensity for muscle fatigue in these individuals.

Title:  Computer vision  
Abstract: This study explored the potential of computer vision system (CVS) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique covering spectral range of 900-1700 nm for identifying freezer burnt salmon fillets after frozen storage. Local binary pattern (LBP) descriptor was applied for the RGB image classification. Reflectance spectra were obtained from various positions surface and pretreated using the standard normal variate (SNV) transformation. TreeBagger classifier was used to build classification models for recognition and authentication of the freezer burnt flesh. The results suggested that hyperspectral discrimination performed much better than CVS with the correct classification rate (CCR) of 0.905 in validation and CCR of 0.945 in cross validation. The effective wavelengths were selected based upon the feature importance in the TreeBagger model and the corresponding optimized model yielded CCR of 0.914 in validation and 0.978 in cross-validation. Overall, the outcome suggested the capability of HSI for rapid categorization of damaged regions on frozen salmon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.

Title:  Fluid mechanics  
Abstract: A multi-pump, multi-piston power take-off wave energy converter ((MPPTO)-P-2 WEC) has been proposed for use with a novel renewable energy harvester termed the Ocean Grazer. The (MPPTO)-P-2 WEC utilizes wave motion to pump via buoys connected to pistons working fluid within a closed circuit and store it as potential energy that can be converted to electricity via turbines. This paper introduces the mechanical design and model-based performance prediction of a single-piston pump that constitutes the basic building block for the (MPPTO)-P-2 WEC. Results provide preliminary validation of aqueous lubrication as a viable means of reducing friction and wear, suggesting that water-based hydraulic fluids can prohibit solid contact at the piston-cylinder interface while reducing volumetric leakage, and allowing for an estimation of the energy extraction efficiency for the mechanical pumping system. Pending more thorough and extended tribological investigations using the methodology introduced in this paper, findings suggest that the overall system efficiency will be dictated by the hydrodynamics of the buoys actuating the pumping system.

Title: Public service values 
Abstract: Public service values are too rarely discussed in public administration courses and scholarship, despite recent research demonstrating the importance of these values in the daily decision making processes of public service professionals.  A discussion of these very tenets and their relevance to core public functions, as well as which areas might elicit value conflicts for public professionals, is central to any comprehensive understanding of budget and finance, human resource management, and strategic planning in the public sector. Public Service Values is written specifically for graduate and undergraduate courses in public administration, wherever a discussion of public service ideals might enrich the learning experience and offer students a better understanding of daily practice.

Title: Psychedelic Chile
Abstract: Patrick Barr-Melej here illuminates modern Chilean history with an unprecedented chronicle and reassessment of the sixties and seventies. During a period of tremendous political and social strife that saw the election of a Marxist president followed by the terror of a military coup in 1973, a youth-driven, transnationally connected counterculture smashed onto the scene. Contributing to a surging historiography of the era's Latin American counterculture, Barr-Melej draws on media and firsthand interviews in documenting the intertwining of youth and counterculture with discourses rooted in class and party politics. Focusing on hippismo and an esoteric movement called Poder Joven, Barr-Melej challenges a number of prevailing assumptions about culture, politics, and the Left under Salvador Allende's Chilean Road to Socialism.While countercultural attitudes toward recreational drug use, gender roles and sexuality, rock music, and consumerism influenced many youths on the Left, the preponderance of leftist leaders shared a more conservative cultural sensibility. This exposed, Barr-Melej argues, a degree of intergenerational dissonance within leftist ranks. And while the allure of new and heterodox cultural values and practices among young people grew, an array of constituencies from the Left to the Right berated counterculture in national media, speeches, schools, and other settings. This public discourse of contempt ultimately contributed to the fierce repression of nonconformist youth culture following the coup.

Title: American higher education
Abstract: The latest book in the Core Concepts in Higher Education series brings to life issues of governance, organization, teaching and learning, student life, faculty, finances, college sports, public policy, fundraising, and innovations in higher education today. Written by renowned author John R. Thelin, each chapter bridges research, theory, and practice and discusses a range of institutions - including the often overlooked for-profits, community colleges, and minority serving institutions. In the book's second edition, Thelin analyzes growing trends in American higher education over the last five years, shedding light on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. He covers reconsideration of the rights of student-athletes, provides fresh analysis of the brick-and-mortar campus, as well includes a new chapter exploring school admissions, recruitment, and retention. Rich end-of-chapter Additional Readings and Questions for Discussion help engage students in critical thinking. A blend of stories and analysis, this book challenges present and future higher education practitioners to be informed and active participants, capable of improving their institutions--

Title:  Osteoporosis  
Abstract: Background and objectives: Body mass index (BMI) has been shown to be a more important predictor of bone mineral density (BMD). The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of anthropometric measures including body mass index with bone mineral density in postmenopausal non-osteoporotic, osteopenic and osteoporotic women. Methods: In this cross sectional study postmenopausal females between 50-70 years of age were recruited and divided into three groups: non-osteoporotic (n= 52), osteopenic (n= 69) and osteoporotic females (n= 47). Anthropometric measures and bone mineral density were assessed. ANOVA was applied to compare groups while Post hoc Tuckey's test was used formultiple comparisons between the groups. Spearman's rho correlation was used to establish correlations. Results: Body mass index (p = 0.034) and hip circumference (p = 0.013) were significantly higher in osteopenic as compared to osteoporotic females and waist to hip ratio was significantly higher (p = 0.005) in osteoporotic as compared to non-osteoporotic females. Significant positive correlation of body mass index was found with T-score (p = 0.022) and ultrasound bone profile index (p< 0.001) in postmenopausal females. Conclusion: High body mass index is associated with high bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk in postmenopausal females. Increasing age and high waist to hip ratio can also lead to reduced bone mineral density in postmenopausal females.

Title:  Headache  
Abstract: Background: It has been hypothesized that a constitutionally narrow cavernous sinus might predispose individuals to cluster headache. Cavernous sinus dimensions, however, have never been assessed. Methods: In this case-control study, we measured the dimensions of the cavernous sinus, skull base, internal carotid and pituitary gland with high-resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in 25 episodic, 24 chronic and 13 probable cluster headache patients, 8 chronic paroxysmal hemicrania patients and 22 headache-free controls. Dimensions were compared between groups, correcting for age, sex and transcranial diameter. Results: On qualitative inspection, no relevant pathology or anatomic variants that were previously associated with cluster headache or chronic paroxysmal hemicranias were observed in the cavernous sinus or paracavernous structures. The left-to-right transcranial diameter at the temporal fossa level (mean +/- SD) was larger in the headache groups (episodic cluster headache: 147.5 +/- 7.3 mm, p = 0.044; chronic cluster headache: 150.2 +/- 7.3 mm, p< 0.001; probable cluster headache: 146.0 +/- 5.3 mm, p = 0.012; and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania: 145.2 +/- 9.4 mm, p = 0.044) compared with controls (140.2 +/- 8.0 mm). After adjusting for transcranial diameter and correcting for multiple comparisons, there were no differences in the dimensions of the cavernous sinus and surrounding structures between headache patients and controls. Conclusion: Patients with cluster headache or chronic paroxysmal hemicrania had wider skulls than headache-free controls, but the proportional dimensions of the cavernous sinus were similar.

Title: LCD soundsystem's sound of silver 
Abstract: When LCD Soundsystem broke up in 2011, they left behind a small but remarkable catalog of music. On top of the genius singles and a longform composition for Nike, there was a trilogy of full-length albums. During that initial run, LCD Soundsystem-and the project's mastermind, James Murphy-were at the center of several 21st century developments in pop culture: indie music's growing mainstream clout, Brooklyn surpassing Manhattan as an epicenter of creativity in America, the collision and eventual erosion of genre perceptions, and the rapid and profound growth and impact of digital culture. Amidst this storm, Murphy crafted Sound Of Silver, the centerpiece of LCD's work.

Title: Personality isn't permanent
Abstract: If you have ever taken a test to identify your personality type, like the Myers-Briggs or Enneagram, you might be surprised to learn that such tests are not only unscientific, but are holding you back. The truth is, there's no such thing as a personality type, or a real you that can only be unearthed through some process of self-discovery. Instead, your personality is something you can intentionally choose and create. Rather than being defined by the past and trapped in unresolved traumas, you can build your identity and internal narrative to serve the future you desire. In Personality Isn't Permanent, Dr. Hardy draws on psychological research to demolish the popular misconception that personality-a person's consistent attitudes and behaviors-is innate and unchanging. He offers practical, motivational advice to help you cultivate the traits and achieve the goals you always dreamed of.

Title: Probabilistic graphical models
Abstract: Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason—to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.

Title: Illuminating Florence
Abstract: This inspirational book, spearheaded by one of the top Florence Nightingale scholars in nursing today, will help nurses relate Florence Nightingale's quotes to today's modern-day practices. The goals and importance of nursing are still the same as they were 150 years ago. And it's fair to say that Nightingale had no idea how much she was going to impact the nursing world while she was a caring for the sick and wounded during the Crimea. With this book, present day nurses can learn that Nightingale was not only just like them, but also that they can make a profound impact on the nursing profession. This book will make Nightingale accessible, relevant, and humanize her a bit, and allow current nurses to find their inner Florence.

Title:  Molecular biology  
Abstract: Background: STAT3 signaling plays the pivotal role in tumorigenesis through EZH2 epigenetic modification, which enhanced STAT3 activity by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Here, another possible feedback mechanism and clinical significance of EZH2 and STAT3 were investigated in gastric cancer (GC). Methods: STAT3, p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) and EZH2 expression were examined in 63 GC specimens with matched normal tissues by IHC staining. EZH2 and STAT3 were also identified in five GC cell lines using RT-PCR and western blot analyses. p-STAT3 protein was detected by western blotting. In order to investigate whether EZH2 expression was directly regulated by STAT3, EZH2 expression was further detected using siRNA for STAT3 or IL-6 stimulation, with dual luciferase reporter analyses, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. The clinical significance of STAT3, p-STAT3 and EZH2 expression was evaluated by multi-factor COX regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results: Hyper-activation of STAT3, p-STAT3 and EZH2 expression were observed in GC cells and tissues. STAT3 signaling was correlated with EZH2 expression in GC (R = 0.373, P = 0.003), which was consistent with our data showing that STAT3 as the transcriptional factor enhanced EZH2 transcriptional activity by binding the relative promoter region (-214 similar to-206). STAT3 was an independent signature for poor survival (P = 0.002). Patients with STAT3(+)/EZH2(+) or p-STAT3(+)/EZH2(+) had a worse outcome than others (P < 0.001); Besides, high levels of STAT3 and EZH2 was associated with advanced TNM staging (P = 0.017). Moreover, treatment with a combination of siSTAT3 and EZH2-specific inhibitor, 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNEP), increased the apoptotic ratio of cells. It is benefit for targeting STAT3-EZH2 interplay in GC treatment. Conclusions: Our results indicate that STAT3 status mediated EZH2 upregulation, associated with advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis, suggesting that combination with knockdown of STAT3 and EZH2 inhibitor might be a novel therapy in GC treatment. Collectively, STAT3, p-STAT3 and EZH2 expression were provided for the precision medicine in GC patients.

Title:  Parallel computing  
Abstract: The next-generation high speed wireless technologies, such as WirelessHD, bring the concept of several Gigabits per second data communication. However, forward error correction that takes place at the receiver side has become a real computational challenge. So far, only hardware solutions have offered such high-speed convolutional decoding, which could not be achieved by software solutions. Our paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a software level solution offering such multi-Gbps convolutional decoding. For this intend, we use the massively parallel computing power of NVIDIA GPGPUs and CUDA programming environment to implement a solution. As a decoding method, the Fano algorithm is selected for its relatively low memory requirements and computational complexity. A look-ahead mechanism and compact history in the form of circular queue is presented to support such high throughput. Conducted tests showed that our GPU based algorithm can decode up to 9.25 Gbps.

Title:  Nonverbal communication  
Abstract: Primary objective: There is considerable evidence suggesting facial affect recognition and cognitive functions are impaired in many people with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, little is known about the relationship between these two domains in the TBI population. Research design: This study investigated the relationship between facial affect recognition and cognitive functioning in 75 adults with moderate-to-severe TBI. Methods and procedures: Participants were administered three facial affect recognition tests and a computerized cognitive test battery that assessed seven cognitive domains. Main outcomes and results: Deficits in facial affect recognition were significantly correlated with impairments in non-verbal memory, working memory, speed of processing, verbal memory and verbal delayed memory. No significant relationship was found between executive dysfunction and facial affect recognition impairments. Non-verbal memory, working memory and speed of processing significantly predicted overall facial affect recognition performance. Conclusions: It is concluded that impairment in several cognitive processes may contribute to facial affect recognition deficits in TBI, in particular non-verbal memory, working memory and speed of processing. Furthermore, executive functioning may not be a critical factor in facial affect recognition, but would most likely be important in deciding what to do once facial affect is perceived.

Title:  Remote Sensing  
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used classifier to show a good performance of hyperspectral data classification. However, such performance could be improved by increasing the diversity that characterizes the ensemble architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble approach, namely rotation random forest via kernel principal component analysis (RoRF-KPCA). In particular, the original feature space is first randomly split into several subsets, and KPCA is performed on each subset to extract high order statistics. The obtained feature sets are merged and used as input to an RF classifier. Finally, the results achieved at each step are fused by a majority vote. Experimental analysis is conducted using real hyperspectral remote sensing images to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with RF, rotation forest, support vector machines, and RoRF-PCA. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title:  network security  
Abstract: Trust is the common factor of any network security. In cloud, trust is the major factor as this trust develops a relation between the user and resource of the service provider. To develop a strong trust there has to be a strong trust path between two entities. The model proposed builds a strong trust path between two important entities in cloud namely user and resources of the service provider. The trust path thus built strengthens the security of the resources as well as the authentication of the user. The implementation proved that trust model developed is more efficient in terms of computation time.

Title:  Autism  
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a complex set of developmental neurological disorders, characterized by deficits in social communication and excessive repetitive behaviors. In recent years, ASD is increasingly being considered as a disease of the synapse. One main type of genetic aberration leading to ASD is gene duplication, and several mouse models have been generated mimicking these mutations. Here, we studied the effects of MECP2 duplication and human chromosome 15q11-13 duplication on synaptic development and neural circuit wiring in the mouse sensory cortices. We showed that mice carrying MECP2 duplication had specific defects in spine pruning, while the 15q11-13 duplication mouse model had impaired spine formation. Our results demonstrate that spine pathology varies significantly between autism models and that distinct aspects of neural circuit development may be targeted in different ASD mutations. Our results further underscore the importance of gene dosage in normal development and function of the brain.

Title: The organist in Victorian literature 
Abstract: The book examines the perception of the organist as the most influential musical figure in Victorian society through the writings of Thomas Hardy and Robert Browning. This will be the first book in the burgeoning area of research into the relationship of music and literature that examines the societal perceptions of a figure central to civic life in Victorian England. This book is deliberately interdisciplinary and will be of special interest to literature scholars and students of Victorian studies, culture, society, religion, gender studies, and music. However, the nature of the text does not require specialist knowledge of music.

Title: Eye-tracking processes and styles in sight translation 
Abstract: This book presents new research on sight translation using cutting-edge eye-tracking technology. It covers various aspects of sight translation processes of both novice and professional interpreters, such as their textual processing behaviors, problem-solving patterns and reading-speech coordination. By focusing on the features of their gaze behaviors, the book describes the interpreters' processing behaviors and categorizes them into different processing styles. As one of the first books on sight translation employing an eye-tracking technique as the research method, it offers a valuable reference guide for future eye-tracking-based translation and interpreting research.

Title:  computer-aided design  
Abstract: Background:Postdecompressive craniotomy defect management following failed prior cranioplastyis challenging. The authors describe a staged technique utilizing free muscle transfer, tissue expansion, and custom polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants for the management of previously failed cranioplasty sites in patients with complicating local factors.Methods:Consecutive patients with previously failed cranioplasties following large decompressive craniectomies underwent reconstruction of skull and soft tissue defects with staged free latissimus muscle transfer, tissue expansion, and placement of custom computer-aided design and modeling PEEK implants with a ""temporalis-plus"" modification to minimize temporal hollowing. Implants were placed in a vascularized pocket at the third stage by elevating a plane between the previously transferred latissimus superficial fascia (left on the skin) and muscle (left on the dura/bone). Patients were evaluated postoperatively for cranioplasty durability, aesthetic outcome, and complications.Results:Six patients with an average of 1.6 previously failed cranioplasties underwent this staged technique. Average age was 33 years. Average defect size was 139 cm(2). Average time to procedure series completion was 14.9 months. There were no flap failures. One patient had early postoperative incisional dehiscence following PEEK implant placement that was managed by immediate scalp flap readvancement. At 21.9 month average follow-up, there were no cranioplasty failures. Three patients (50%) underwent 4 subsequent refining outpatient procedures. All patients achieved complete coverage of their craniectomy defect site with hear-bearing skin, acceptable head shape, and normalized head contour.Conclusions:The described technique resulted in aesthetic, durable craniectomy defect reconstruction with retention of native hear-bearing scalp skin in a challenging patient population.

Title:  Borderline personality disorder  
Abstract: Meaning in life has been found to be a protective factor against suicidal ideation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether meaning in life can moderate and buffer the association between suicide risk factors and hopelessness in women with borderline personality disorders. One hundred twenty-four women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder completed self-report measures of suicide risk factors, hopelessness, and meaning in life. The main result from this study was that meaning in life moderated the association between suicide risk factors and hopelessness. Meaning in life is an important variable in the prevention and treatment of risk of suicide in women with borderline personality disorder.

Title: Change everything
Abstract: Is it possible for businesses to have a bottom line that is not profit and endless growth, but human dignity, justice, sustainability and democracy? Or an alternative economic model that is untainted by the greed and crises of current financial systems? Christian Felber says it is. Moreover, in Change Everything he shows us how. The Economy for the Common Good is not just an idea, but has already become a broad international movement with thousands of people, hundreds of companies, and dozens of communities and organizations participating, developing and implementing it. Published in English for the first time, this is a remarkable blueprint for change that will profoundly influence debates on reshaping our economy for the future. -- Publisher's description.

Title: The Mexican heartland
Abstract: The Mexican Heartland provides a new history of capitalism from the perspective of the landed communities surrounding Mexico City. In a sweeping analytical narrative spanning the sixteenth century to today, John Tutino challenges our basic assumptions about the forces that shaped global capitalism setting families and communities at the center of histories that transformed the world. Despite invasion, disease, and depopulation, Mexico's heartland communities held strong on the land, adapting to sustain and shape the dynamic silver capitalism so pivotal to Spain's empire and world trade for centuries after 1550. They joined in insurgencies that brought the collapse of silver and other key global trades after 1810 as Mexico became a nation, then struggled to keep land and self-rule in the face of liberal national projects. They drove Zapata's 1910 revolution a rising that rattled Mexico and the world of industrial capitalism. Although the revolt faced defeat, adamant communities forced a land reform that put them at the center of Mexico's experiment in national capitalism after 1920. Then, from the 1950s, population growth and technical innovations drove people from rural communities to a metropolis spreading across the land. The heartland urbanized, leaving people searching for new lives--dependent, often desperate, yet still pressing their needs in a globalizing world. --

Title: Lord Byron and Scandalous Celebrity 
Abstract: The Regency period in general, and the aristocrat-poet Lord Byron in particular, were notorious for scandal, but the historical circumstances of this phenomenon have yet to be properly analysed. Lord Byron and Scandalous Celebrity explores Byron's celebrity persona in the literary, social, political and historical contexts of Regency Britain and post-Napoleonic Europe that produced it. Clara Tuite argues that the Byronic enigma that so compelled contemporary audiences - and provoked such controversy with its spectacular Romantic Satanism - can be understood by means of 'scandalous celebrity', a new form of ambivalent fame that mediates between notoriety and traditional forms of heroic renown. Examining Byron alongside contemporary figures including Caroline Lamb, Stendhal, Napoleon Bonaparte and Lord Castlereagh, Tuite illuminates the central role played by Byron in the literary, political and sexual scandals that mark the Regency as a vital period of social transition and emergent celebrity culture--

Title:  Molecular biology  
Abstract: Telomerase activation is critical in many cancers including central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Imetelstat is an oligonucleotide that binds to the template region of the RNA component of telomerase, inhibiting its enzymatic activity. We conducted an investigator-sponsored molecular biology (MB) and phase II study to estimate inhibition of tumor telomerase activity and sustained responses by imetelstat in children with recurrent CNS malignancies. In the MB study, patients with recurrent medulloblastoma, high-grade glioma (HGG) or ependymoma undergoing resection received one dose of imetelstat as a 2-h intravenous infusion at 285 mg/m(2), 12-24 h before surgery. Telomerase activity was evaluated in fresh tumor from surgery. Post-surgery and in the phase II study, patients received imetelstat IV (days 1 and 8 q21-days) at 285 mg/m(2). Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed. Of two evaluable patients on the MB trial, intratumoral telomerase activity was inhibited by 95 % compared to baseline archival tissue in one patient and was inevaluable in one patient. Forty-two patients (40 evaluable for toxicity) were enrolled: 9 medulloblastomas, 18 HGG, 4 ependymomas, 9 diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Most common grade 3/4 toxicities included thrombocytopenia (32.5 %), lymphopenia (17.5 %), neutropenia (12.5 %), ALT (7.5 %) and AST (5 %) elevation. Two patients died of intratumoral hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia leading to premature study closure. No objective responses were observed. Telomerase inhibition was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for at least 8 days. Imetelstat demonstrated intratumoral and PBMC target inhibition; the regimen proved too toxic in children with recurrent CNS tumors.

Title:  Emergency Contraception  
Abstract: In March 2015, the oral emergency contraceptives levonorgestrel (LNG) and ulipristal acetate (UPA) were released from prescription-only status in Germany. The main research question is to analyse whether the OTC status of oral emergency contraceptives has an influence on the patterns of use. All information is based on searches for public domain sources on emergency contraception. Searches were made for scientific publications, statistics, and surveys. Due to additional active ingredient properties, UPA is superior to LNG in terms of ovulation-inhibiting effect. Since the OTC switch, demand for oral emergency contraceptives has risen by almost 50%, especially at weekends when sexual encounters and thus contraceptive failures are most frequent. However, the age distribution of the users has not changed as a result of the OTC switch. Doctors still play an important role in advising on emergency contraception after the removal of the prescription-only requirement. Pregnancies despite emergency contraception are terminated in more than half of the cases. In federal states with higher rates of use of the morning-after pill, fewer terminations of pregnancy were performed. As a result of the OTC switch, more women and girls use the morning-after pill after unprotected intercourse and the time between unprotected intercourse and taking the oral emergency contraceptive decreases. This is of great advantage in terms of the mechanism of action. UPA is used more frequently than LNG. Only half of all people aged between 16 and 39 years in Germany are aware of the morning-after pill and 94% of women who had a pregnancy terminated in 2015 did not use any emergency contraception after the unprotected intercourse. In the population, there is still a great need for information and education on contraception and emergency contraception.

Title: The Klein-Winnicott dialectic
Abstract: This book brings together the theories of Melanie Klein and Donald W. Winnicott, two giants and geniuses of the British school of object relations clinical and developmental theory and psychoanalytic technique. In this book, Dr Kavaler-Adler attempts to integrate the theories of Klein and Winnicott, rather than polarising them, as has been done often in the past. This book takes the best of Klein and Winnicott for use by clinicians on an everyday basis, without having the disputes between their followers interfere with the full and rich platter of theoretical offerings they each of them provided. In addition, this book looks at the biographies of Klein and Winnicott, to show how their theories were inspired by their contrasting lives and contrasting parenting and developmental dynamics. By examining their theories in relation to their biographies, one can see why their dialectical theoretical focuses emerged, highly contrasted in their major emphasis, and yet highly complementary when applied together to clinical work. This is a very new perspective.

Title: Alien imaginations
Abstract: The figure of the alien is at the heart of science fiction and has helped us to understand and explore interactions with other cultures and the possibilities of life beyond both the modern configuration of the nation-state and the natural order of life on earth. Alien Imaginations brings together canonical and contemporary works in the cinema and literature of science fiction, transnationalism, and globalization in order to examine the role of the alien as well as the realities of migration, labor, and life in the twenty-first century. The essays in this collection discuss films such as District 9, Avatar, and Code 46, as well as novels by H.G. Wells, Philip K. Dick, or Ray Bradbury. As we continue down the road to a global economy and culture, Alien Imaginations offers a critical reflection upon our 'imagined realities' while also turning to speculative fiction and cinema to provide us with examples of resistance, if not a utopian horizon--

Title:  Social cognition  
Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated impairments in social cognition associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). The present work asks whether these impairments are associated with atypical moral judgment. Specifically, we assessed whether MS patients are able to integrate information about intentions and outcomes for moral judgment (i.e., appropriateness and punishment judgments) in the case of third-party acts. We found a complex pattern of moral judgments in MS patients: although their moral judgments were comparable to controls' for specific types of acts (e.g., accidental or intentional harms), they nevertheless judged behaviors to be less appropriate and endorsed more severe punishment across the board, and they were also more likely to report that others' responses would be congruent with theirs. Further analyses suggested that elevated levels of externally oriented cognition in MS (due to co-occurring alexithymia) explain these effects. Additionally, we found that the distinction between appropriateness and punishment judgments, whereby harmful outcomes influence punishment judgments to a greater extent than appropriateness judgments, was preserved in MS despite the observed disruptions in the affective and motivational components of empathy. The current results inform the two-process model for intent-based moral judgments as well as possible strategies for improving the quality of life in MS patients.

Title:  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis  
Abstract: In the nineteenth century, there was a dispute about the existence of a lung alveolar epithelium which remained unsolved until the invention of electron microscopy (EM) and its application to the lung. From the early 1960s, Ewald Weibel became the master of lung EM. He showed that the alveolar epithelium is covered with a lining layer containing surfactant. Weibel also explained the phenomenon of ""non-nucleated plates"" observed already in 1881 by Albert Kolliker. Weibel's most significant contribution was to the development of stereological methods. Therefore, quantitative characterization of lung structure revealing structure-function relationships became possible. Today, the spectrum of EM methods to study the fine structure of the lung has been extended significantly. Cryo-preparation techniques are available which are necessary for immunogold labeling of molecules. Energy-filtering techniques can be used for the detection of elements. There have also been major improvements in stereology, thus providing a very versatile toolbox for quantitative lung phenotype analyses. A new dimension was added by 3D EM techniques. Depending on the desired sample size and resolution, the spectrum ranges from array tomography via serial block face scanning EM and focused ion beam scanning EM to electron tomography. These 3D datasets provide new insights into lung ultrastructure. Biomedical EM is an ever-developing field. Its high resolution remains unparalleled. Moreover, EM has the unique advantage of providing an ""open view"" into cells and tissues within their full architectural context. Therefore, EM will remain an indispensable tool for a better understanding of the lung's functional design.

Title:  Computer programming  
Abstract: An important number of academic tasks should be solved collaboratively by groups of learners. The Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems support this collaboration by means of shared workspaces and tools that enable communication and coordination between learners. Successful collaboration and interaction can depend on the criteria followed when forming the groups of learners. This paper proposes a method that analyses the collaboration and interaction between learners using a set of indicators or variables about how they solve academic tasks. Then, the concept of data depth is used as a measurement of the closeness of the analysis indicators' values for a learner with respect to the values that the same indicators take for the other learners. Finally, the data depth is used to form new groups of learners whose analysis indicators take similar or different values. Thus, the method enables teachers to form homogeneous and heterogeneous groups according to their preferences. This group formation process is carried out automatically by a software tool. This paper presents two case studies in which the method is applied to form groups of learners who solve academic tasks in different domains (computer programming and data mining).

Title:  Northern blotting  
Abstract: Methods. The expression of Cyr61 and NF-kappa B pathway molecules was examined by western blotting. CCL2 expression was assessed by northern blotting and ELISA. Interaction between NF-kappa B and Cyr61 promoter was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In rat CIA, osteoblastic expression of Cyr61 was examined by immunohistochemistry and disease progression was assessed by clinical, radiographic and histological examinations. Results. EGCG inhibited Cyr61 expression stimulated by cytokines in primary human osteoblasts and human osteoblastic cell line U2OS. In U2OS, oncostatin M (OSM) induced I kappa B-alpha degradation through the mTOR/rictor/Akt pathway, and EGCG attenuated the action. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the OSM-enhanced NF-kappa B/DNA binding was reduced by EGCG, possibly through abrogating nucleus localization of p65 and p50. Cyr61 enhanced OSM-induced expression of CCL2. Moreover, EGCG diminished OSM-stimulated CCL2 expression at least partially via suppressing Cyr61 induction. Co-distribution of CD68(+) macrophages and Cyr61(+) osteoblasts in osteolytic areas was obvious in the CIA model. Clinical, radiographic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that administration of EGCG markedly diminished the severity of CIA, macrophage infiltration, and the number of Cyr61-synthesizing osteoblasts. Conclusion. By modulating the mTOR/rictor/Akt/NF-kappa B pathway, EGCG attenuated Cyr61 production in osteoblastic cells and in turn diminished macrophage chemotaxis. Our data support the therapeutic potential of EGCG on arthritis.

Title:  Attention  
Abstract: Superconducting synchronous generators (SCSGs) are drawing more attention in large direct-drive wind turbine applications. Despite low weight and compactness, the short circuit torque of an SCSG may be too high for wind turbine constructions due to a large magnetic air gap of an SCSG. This paper aims at assessing the effects of armature winding segmentation on reducing the short circuit torque of 10-MW SCSGs. A concept of armature winding segmentation with multiple power electronic converters is presented. Four SCSG designs using different topologies are examined. Results show that armature winding segmentation effectively reduce the short circuit torque in all the four SCSG designs when one segment is shorted at the terminal.

Title: IT sustainability for business advantage 
Abstract: IT Sustainability for Business Advantage speaks to modern managers in all functions as well as to IT professionals. Implementing an effective IT sustainability strategy is essential for organizations pursuing sustainability as a means of business advantage and this book shows how to do it. The critical first step is getting clear about the ends of the IT sustainability program--the mission must be to further the company's sustainability objectives and strategic intents should include: 1) Making IT operations as sustainable as possible; 2) Partnering with other functions to leverage IT in making their business processes more sustainable and to grow the business; and 3) Building a culture of sustainability within the IT organization. The next step is to implement strategies to achieve these ends and the book explores the ways and means of doing this. These include industry best practices on how to apply the processes, techniques, and technologies related to Green IT and IT for Sustainability (ITfS). They also include techniques for change management and building social capital.

Title: Product design and the supply chain
Abstract: Product design touches every aspect of modern life, determining the form and function of the products and technologies that we use every day. Product design is not just concerned with the appearance and functionality of products; it has an important role in determining the cost, pricing, risk and profitability profile of those products. Product Design and the Supply Chain shows how decisions taken at the design stage of a product's life cycle go on to affect that product's subsequent value to a company. Eighty per cent of a product's eventual supply chain costs are already present at the early stages of product design and development. This book will allow companies to make informed design decisions that will have significant positive through-life implications for risk, complexity and responsiveness, thus allowing them to create a 'moat' that is difficult for competitors to sidestep or surmount--

Title:  Operating systems  
Abstract: ROS, an open-source robot operating system, is widely used and rapidly developed in the robotics community. However, running on Linux, ROS does not provide real-time guaranteeS, while real-time tasks are required in many robot applications such as robot motion control. This paper for the first time presents a real-time ROS architecture called RT-RTOS on multi-core processors. RT-ROS provides an integrated real-time/non-real-time task execution environment so real-time and non-real-time ROS nodes can be separately run on a real-time OS and Linux, respectively, with different processor cores. In such a way, real-time tasks can be supported by real-time ROS nodes on a real-time OS, while non-real-time ROS nodes on Linux can provide other functions of ROS. Furthermore, high performance is achieved by executing real-time ROS nodes and non-real-time ROS nodes on different processor cores. We have implemented RT-ROS on a dual-core processor and conducted various experiments with real robot applications. The experimental results show that RT-ROS can effectively provide real-time support for the ROS platform with high performance by exploring the multi-core architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title:  Seasonal affective disorder  
Abstract: Brief Morning Exposure to Bright Light Improves Subjective Symptoms and Performance in Nurses with Rapidly Rotating Shifts: Katsutoshi TANAKA, et al. Department of Occupational Mental Health, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kitasato University-Objective: To investigate whether or not brief bright light (BL) exposure on workday mornings can improve health, performance and safety in nurses with rapidly rotating shifts. Methods: We conducted a randomized crossover study involving registered nurses at a teaching hospital working a two-shift system including the night shift. Participants were instructed to expose themselves to BL for 10 min on workday mornings. Results: A total of 61 participants were enrolled in the present study. Thirty-one participants received BL exposure in the first month, and the other 30 received it in the second month. Significant improvements were noted in the BL periods compared with the non-BL periods for self-assessed sleepiness at 10:00 on day-shift days evaluated using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, self-assessment of night sleep for day-shift days using the Visual Analogue Scale and for fatigue assessed using the Checklist Individual Strength Questionnaire. The estimated mean difference for each scale (95% confidence interval) was -0.55 (-0.91, -0.20), 0.37 (0.04, 0.70) and -2.13 (-3.78, -0.48), respectively. Mean response time evaluated using the psychomotor vigilance task test (PVT) showed significant improvement in the BL periods compared with the non-BL periods. No statistically significant differences were observed for sleepiness at 14:00, depression, number of PVT lapses or frequency of perceived adverse events and near misses. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that brief BL exposure on mornings preceding a day shift is effective in improving sleepiness and performance during day-shift work, subjective nighttime sleep on day-shift days, and perceived fatigue for the preceding two weeks in rapidly rotating shift nurses.

Title:  Algorithm design  
Abstract: The regular hybrid flow shop scheduling problem, with m stages, identical parallel machines and makespan minimization, is investigated and served as the natural starting point for the hybrid flow shop scheduling problems. Some properties of this scheduling problem were discussed, and they lead to the theoretical foundation and instruction for algorithm design. Based on the active scheduling technique and reversibility property, a genetic algorithm with direction selection combined with extended Giffler & Thompson algorithm was developed. The experimental results of benchmark problems and comparisons with two other algorithms indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Broad band
Abstract: The history of technology you probably know is one of men and machines, garages and riches, alpha nerds and brogrammers. But the little-known fact is that female visionaries have always been at the vanguard of technology and innovation--they've just been erased from the story. Until now. Women are not ancillary to the history of technology; they turn up at the very beginning of every important wave. But they've often been hidden in plain sight, their inventions and contributions touching our lives in ways we don't even realize. VICE reporter and YACHT lead singer Claire L. Evans finally gives these unsung female heroes their due with her insightful social history of the Broad Band, the women who made the internet what it is today. Learn from Ada Lovelace, the tortured, imaginative daughter of Lord Byron, who wove numbers into the first program for a mechanical computer in 1842. Seek inspiration from Grace Hopper, the tenacious mathematician who democratized computing by leading the charge for machine-independent programming languages after World War II. Meet Elizabeth Jake Feinler, the one-woman Google who kept the earliest version of the Internet online, and Stacy Horn, who ran one of the first-ever social networks on a shoestring out of her New York City apartment in the 1980s. Evans shows us how these women built and colored the technologies we can't imagine life without. Join the ranks of the pioneers who defied social convention and the longest odds to become database poets, information-wranglers, hypertext dreamers, and glass ceiling-shattering dot com-era entrepreneurs. This inspiring call to action is a revelation: women have embraced technology from the start. It shines a light on the bright minds whom history forgot, and shows us how they will continue to shape our world in ways we can no longer ignore. Welcome to the Broad Band. You're next--

Title: LIDAR Laser Radar Finding More Uses (AP)
Abstract: AP - If you've ever been pulled over for speeding, you may already know something about LIDAR. A laser-based radar system, LIDAR can tell if you're speeding by bouncing a light beam off your car and seeing how quickly it returns. From an airplane or a satellite, LIDAR can calculate the distance to the ground, and by repeating the process millions of times as it flies over, map the lay of the land.

Title: The future of work
Abstract: Throughout the history of business employees had to adapt to managers and managers had to adapt to organizations. In the future this is reversed with managers and organizations adapting to employees. This means that in order to succeed and thrive, organizations must rethink and challenge everything they know about work. The demographics of employees are changing and so are employee expectations, values, attitudes, and styles of working. Conventional management models must be replaced with leadership approaches adapted to the future employee. Organizations must also rethink their traditional structure, how they empower employees, and what they need to do to remain competitive in a rapidly changing world. This is a book about how employees of the future will work, how managers will lead, and what organizations of the future will look like. -- Publisher website

Title:  Materials Engineering  
Abstract: Atomic-scale tomography (AST) is defined and its place in microscopy is considered. Arguments are made that AST, as defined, would be the ultimate microscopy. The available pathways for achieving AST are examined and we conclude that atom probe tomography (APT) may be a viable basis for AST on its own and that APT in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy is a likely path as well. Some possible configurations of instrumentation for achieving AST are described. The concept of metaimages is introduced where data from multiple techniques are melded to create synergies in a multidimensional data structure. When coupled with integrated computational materials engineering, structure-properties microscopy is envisioned. The implications of AST for science and technology are explored.

Title:  Nonverbal communication  
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Individuals who have had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) often have difficulty processing nonverbal communication (Ekman, 1976) The published research in this area has focused on a TBI patient's ability to recognize facial expression, vocal intonation, and postural expression (Croker, 2005; Hopkins, Dywan & Segalowitz, 2002). OBJECTIVE: This study compared the non-verbal processing skills of brain-injured patients versus non-injured controls in all three domains. METHODS: The stimuli were photographs of facial and postural expressions and audio recordings of intonational expressions. RESULTS: The results indicated that persons with TBI have particular difficulty recognizing non-verbal communication resulting from vocal intonations. CONCLUSIONS: The TBI patients had difficulty processing tonality, therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that clinicians, friends, and family members should emphasize the explicit verbal content of spoken language when speaking to a person with TBI.

Title: Following the textual revolution
Abstract: Analysis of literature and culture abounds in modern scholarship, customarily written in the familiar language of literary theory. Though the terminology today seems (more or less) straightforward, this was not always the case. The propositions for a new and active understanding of 'text,' put forward in the 1960s by theorists like Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida, profoundly influenced contemporary critical thought and were unnerving to many. This book examines how a divergent school of literary and cultural studies created French Theory, appropriated its ideas about text and texuality and altered the landscape of debate in mainstream academic discourse. The author traces the standardization of a once 'rebellious' poststructuralism and presents contemporary critical thinking that questions the assumptions of 'Theory'--

Title:  Myelofibrosis  
Abstract: Objectives: To describe three methods used to screen for frameshift mutations in exon 9 of the CALR gene. Methods: Genomic DNA from 47 patients was extracted from peripheral blood and bone marrow using the EZ1 DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified by the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). After clinical history, cytogenetics, and molecular tests, patients were diagnosed with either clonal or nonclonal hematologic diseases. CALR screening was primarily performed using fragment analysis polymerase chain reaction, then next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing. Results: Among the 18 patients diagnosed with clonal diseases, one had acute myeloid leukemia (positive for trisomy 8), and 17 had myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and polycythemia vera (PV). Patients with CML were positive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion. Ten patients were positive for JAK2 (PMF, n = 1; ET, n = 2; PV, n = 7), and three were CALR positive (ET, n = 1; PMF, n = 2). Patients diagnosed with a nonclonal disease were negative for JAK2, BCR-ABL, and CALR mutations. Conclusions: Screening for CALR mutations is essential in BCR-ABL negative MPNs since it not only provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information but also identifies potential treatment targets. Since this study describes the importance of screening for known and novel biomarkers, we described in detail three methods that could be easily integrated into a clinical laboratory.

Title: Negation, subjectivity, and the history of rhetoric 
Abstract: Vitanza introduces his book with the questions: What Do I Want, Wanting to Write This ('our') Book? What Do I Want, Wanting You to Read This ('our') Book? Thereafter, in a series of chapters and excursions and as schizographer of rhetorics (erotics), he interrogates three recent, influential historians of Sophists (Edward Schiappa, John Poulakos, and Susan Jarratt), and how these historians as well as others represent Sophists and, in particular, Isocrates and Gorgias under the sign of the negative. Vitanza concludes - rather rebegins in a sophistic-performative excursus - with a prelude to future (anterior) histories of rhetorics. Vitanza asks: What will have been anti-Oedipalizedized (de-negated) hysteries of rhetorics? What will have they looked like, sounded, read like? Or to ask affirmatively, what, then, will have libidinalized-hysteries of rhetorics looked, sounded, read like?

Title: Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson
Abstract: In this book, Darren Staloff forcefully reminds us that America owes its guiding political traditions to three founding fathers whose lives embodied the collision of Europe's grand Enlightenment project with the birth of the nation. Alexander Hamilton, the worldly New Yorker; John Adams, the curmudgeonly Yankee; Thomas Jefferson, the visionary Virginia squire - each steered his public life under the guideposts and constraints of Enlightenment principles, and for each his relationship to the politics of Enlightenment was transformed by the struggle for American independence. Repeated humiliation on America's battlefields banished Hamilton's youthful idealism, leaving him a fervent disciple of enlightened realpolitik and the nation's leading exponent of modern statecraft. After ten years in Europe's diplomatic trenches, Adams changed his stance toward the politics of Enlightenment, a stance that became increasingly that of the gadfly of his country. And Jefferson's frustrations as a reformer and then Revolutionary governor in Virginia led him to go beyond his previous enlightened worldview, and to articulate a new and radical Romantic politics of principle. As a consequence, Americans demand a government that is modern and efficient yet constrained by checks and balances, one capable of appealing to our loftiest aspirations while adhering to decidedly pragmatic policies. Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson is a reminder that the world of ideas is inextricably bound up in the long trajectory of historical events.--BOOK JACKET.

Title: Aesthetics and neo-romanticism in film
Abstract: The contemporary study of film is dominated by narrative theory - yet films include scenes and images which do not perform a narrative task but nevertheless provoke an emotional response. Stella Hockenhull looks at the painterly dimensions inherent in the medium of film, arguing that an aesthetic analysis enables a fuller appreciation of the visual 'spectacle' of cinema. In a reading of the formal aspects in film imagery in contemporary British films spanning social realist, melodrama and horror genres, Hockenhull demonstrates how the spiritual aspects of landscape and nature mobilise a Neo-Romantic effect. She traces the influence of Romanticism and notions of the Sublime in key British films including Sweet Sixteen, The Queen, Ratcatcher, Eden Lake, 28 Days Later, My Summer of Love and The Last Great Wilderness. Operating at the intersection between film theory, art theory and aesthetics, this is a vital contribution which enables a fuller, multidimensional understanding of cinematic experience.

Title: Maurice Gee
Abstract: Maurice Gee is one of New Zealand's greatest fiction writers. His long literary career began in the 1950s and includes seventeen adult novels, thirteen novels for children, a short story collection, and screenplays for television and film. His work is loved by generations of readers and has earned him many awards. In this revelatory new work, acclaimed biographer Rachel Barrowman interweaves the story of Gee's life with his fiction, illuminating the unassuming 'man in the grey cardy' alongside his unsettling stories. Immaculately researched, with full access to her subject and his records, Maurice Gee: Life and Work offers a fascinating portrait of a writing life. Gee once described himself as 'a New-Zealandy sort of writer living in a New-Zealandy sort of place .?.?. writing New-Zealandy sort of books'. His work has always drawn from a particular, personal New Zealand; his fictional territory takes in the domestic lives and landscapes of New Zealand's provincial towns and middle-class suburbs-places where murders happen, where families hurt and self-destruct. Through decades of changing literary fashions, Gee has gone on doing his own thing, seeking out 'evidence of disorder, passion, of the primitive thing'. Maurice Gee: Life and Work explores the connections and paradoxes of a private man who has written his life into fiction. It is a compelling story of a life and a major contribution to New Zealand literary history.

Title:  Problem-solving  
Abstract: The attentional scope model of rumination predicts that rumination is associated with a narrowed attentional scope which magnifies emotional responding and reduces problem-solving. This study examined this prediction by using a moving window paradigm, allowing for a more direct measurement of attentional scope at a perceptual level. High and low trait ruminators were asked to read self-related and other-related sentences under small, medium, large, and no moving window conditions while their visual fixations during reading were recorded. Results showed significant group differences in the small window size condition, with the high rumination group processing faster and making fewer fixations when reading the sentences. Further analyses confirmed that differences remained after controlling for mood state and the level of depression. These findings indicate that people with high levels of trait rumination are characterized by a narrower attentional scope when processing information. Clinical implications in relation to rumination are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Green Building  
Abstract: Green eco-friendly housing includes approaches to reduce indoor air pollutant sources and to increase energy efficiency. Although sealing/tightening buildings can save energy and reduce the penetration of outdoor pollutants, an adverse outcome can be increased buildup of pollutants with indoor sources. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the indoor air quality (IAQ) between green and non-green homes in low-income housing complexes. In one housing complex, apartments were renovated using green principles (n = 28). Home visits were conducted immediately after the renovation, and subsequently at 6 months and at 12 months following the renovation. Of these homes, eight homes had pre-renovation home visits; this allowed pre- and post-renovation comparisons within the same homes. Parallel visits were conducted in non-green (control) apartments (n = 14) in a nearby low-income housing complex. The IAQ assessments included PM2.5, black carbon, ultrafine particles, sulfur, total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and air exchange rate. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. None of the indoor pollutant concentrations were significantly different between green and non-green homes. However, we found differences when comparing the concentrations before and after renovation. Measured immediately after renovation, indoor black carbon concentrations were significantly lower averaging 682 ng/m(3) in post-renovation vs. 2364 ng/m(3) in pre-renovation home visits (p = 0.01). In contrast, formaldehyde concentrations were significantly higher in post-renovated (0.03 ppm) than in pre-renovated homes (0.01 ppm) (p = 0.004). Questionnaire data showed that opening of windows occurred less frequently in homes immediately post-renovation compared to pre-renovation; this factor likely affected the levels of indoor black carbon (from outdoor sources) and formaldehyde (from indoor sources) more than the renovation status itself. To reduce IAQ problems and potentially improve health, careful selection of indoor building materials and ensuring sufficient ventilation are important for green building designs.

Title:  Fungal Infection  
Abstract: Background: Although in the past decade the management of invasive fungal infections has improved, a number of controversies persist regarding empirical antifungal treatment in critically-ill hematology patients. Aims: To identify key clinical knowledge to elaborate a set of recommendations, with a high level of consensus, necessary for the approach to fungal infections in critically-ill hematology patients. Methods: A Spanish prospective questionnaire, which measures consensus through the Delphi technique, was anonymously answered and e-mailed by 30 multidisciplinary national experts, all specialists in fungal invasive infections from six scientific national societies; intensivists, anesthesiologists, microbiologists, pharmacologists and specialists in infectious diseases. They responded to 10 questions prepared by the coordination group after a thorough review of the literature published in the last few years. For a category to be selected, the level of agreement among the experts in each category must be equal to or greater than 70%. In a second round, 73 specialists attended a face-to-face meeting held after extracting the recommendations from the chosen topics, and validated the pre-selected recommendations and derived algorithm. Results: Assess administering antifungal treatment to patients with high/medium risk factors and fever for over 4 days after onset of antibiotic therapy, and in the event of negative galactomannan or if no detection analysis has been performed and no relevant findings in the sinus and chest computed tomography (CT) have been detected, (1) in the case the patient did not receive prophylaxis, or was administered fluconazole, caspofungin treatment is recommended; (2) in the event the patient received prophylaxis with an azole with activity against filamentous fungi, the administration of liposomal amphotericin B is recommended and caspofungin as second choice therapy; (3) in the event that the prophylaxis received was an echinocandin, liposomal amphotericin B therapy is recommended and voriconazole as second choice. Assess administering antifungal treatment in patients with high/medium risk factors and fever for more than 4 days after onset of antibiotic therapy, and in the event of a positive galactomannan and/or sinus and chest CT suggests fungal infection caused by filamentous fungi, (1) in the event the patient did not receive antifungal prophylaxis or was administered fluconazole, the recommended treatment of choice is voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B; (2) if the patient received prophylaxis with an azole with activity against filamentous fungi, the administration of liposomal amphotericin B with caspofungin is recommended and monotherapy with liposomal amphotericin B or the combination of voriconazole and anidulafungin are recommended as second choice therapies; (3) in the event an echinocandin was administered as prophylaxis, liposomal amphotericin B or voriconazole are the recommended treatments of choice. Consider the administration of antifungal treatment in patients with high/medium risk factors and fever for more than 4 days after onset of antibiotic therapy, and in the event of a negative galactomannan and the sinus and chest CT suggests fungal infection caused by filamentous fungi, (1) if the patient did not receive prophylaxis or was administered fluconazole, the recommended treatment of choice is liposomal amphotericin B or voriconazole; (2) in the case the patient received prophylaxis with an azole with activity against filamentous fungi, the administration of liposomal amphotericin B is recommended as first choice therapy and liposomal amphotericin B combined with caspofungin as second choice; (3) in the event an echinocandin was administered as prophylaxis, liposomal amphotericin B or voriconazole are the recommended treatments of choice. Conclusions: The empirical antifungal approach in critically-ill hematology patients requires the application of the broad range of knowledge and skills described in our recommendations and algorithm. These recommendations, based on the DELPHI methodology, may help to identify potential patients, standardize their management and improve overall prognosis.

Title: Cosmography and the idea of Hyperborea in ancient Greece
Abstract: Cosmography is defined here as the rhetoric of cosmology: the art of composing worlds. The mirage of Hyperborea, which played a substantial role in Greek religion and culture throughout Antiquity, offers a remarkable window into the practice of composing and reading worlds. This book follows Hyperborea across genres and centuries, both as an exploration of the extraordinary record of Greek thought on that further North and as a case study of ancient cosmography and the anthropological philology that tracks ancient cosmography. Trajectories through the many forms of Greek thought on Hyperborea shed light on key aspects of the cosmography of cult and the cosmography of literature. The philology of worlds pursued in this book ranges from Archaic hymns to Hellenistic and Imperial reconfigurations of Hyperborea. A thousand years of cosmography is thus surveyed through the rewritings of one idea. This is a book on the art of reading worlds slowly--

Title: The metric society
Abstract: In today’s world, numbers are in the ascendancy. Societies dominated by star ratings, scores, likes and lists are rapidly emerging, as data are collected on virtually every aspect of our lives. From annual university rankings, ratings agencies and fitness tracking technologies to our credit score and health status, everything and everybody is measured and evaluated.In this important new book, Steffen Mau offers a critical analysis of this increasingly pervasive phenomenon. While the original intention behind the drive to quantify may have been to build trust and transparency, Mau shows how metrics have in fact become a form of social conditioning. The ubiquitous language of ranking and scoring has changed profoundly our perception of value and status. What is more, through quantification, our capacity for competition and comparison has expanded significantly – we can now measure ourselves against others in practically every area. The rise of quantification has created and strengthened social hierarchies, transforming qualitative differences into quantitative inequalities that play a decisive role in shaping the life chances of individuals.This timely analysis of the pernicious impact of quantification will appeal to students and scholars across the social sciences, as well as anyone concerned by the cult of numbers and its impact on our lives and societies today.

Title: The Bielski brothers
Abstract: In 1941, three brothers witnessed their parents and two other siblings being led away to their eventual murders. It was a grim scene that would, of course, be repeated endlessly throughout the war. Instead of running or giving in to despair, these brothers -- Tuvia, Zus, and Asael Bielski -- fought back, waging a guerrilla war of wits against the Nazis. By using their intimate knowledge of the dense forests surrounding the Belarusan towns of Novogrudek and Lida, the Bielskis evaded the Nazis and established a hidden base camp, then set about convincing other Jews to join their ranks. As more and more Jews arrived each day, a robust community began to emerge, a Jerusalem in the woods. In July, after two and a half years in the woods the Bielskis learned that the Germans, overrun by the Red Army, were retreating back toward Berlin. More than one thousand Bielski Jews emerged -- alive -- on that final, triumphant exit from the woods. But as nororitey grew, so too did the Nazi efforts to capture the rugged brothers and on several occasions they came so near to succeding that the Bielskis had to abandon the camp and lead their massive entourage to newer, safer locaitons. And while some argued in favor of a smaller, more mobile unit, focused strictly on waging battle against the Germans, Tuvia Bielski was firm in his commitment to all Jews. I`d rather save on old Jewish woman, he said, than kill ten Nazis.

Title: Internationalism or extinction 
Abstract: In his new book, Noam Chomsky writes cogently about the threats to planetary survival that are of growing alarm today. The prospect of human extinction emerged after World War II, the dawn of a new era scientists now term the Anthropocene. Chomsky uniquely traces the duality of existential threats from nuclear weapons and from climate change-including how the concerns emerged and evolved, and how the threats can interact with one another. The introduction and accompanying interviews place these dual threats in a framework of unprecedented corporate global power which has overtaken nation states' ability to control the future and preserve the planet. Chomsky argues for the urgency of international climate and arms agreements, showing how global popular movements are mobilizing to force governments to meet this unprecedented challenge to civilization's survival

Title: Affective landscapes in literature, art and everyday life
Abstract: Bringing together a diverse group of scholars representing the fields of cultural and literary studies, cultural politics and history, creative writing and photography, this collection examines the different ways in which human beings respond to, debate and interact with landscape. How do we feel, sense, know, cherish, memorise, imagine, dream, desire or even fear landscape? What are the specific qualities of experience that we can locate in the spaces in and through which we live? While the essays most often begin with the broadly literary - the memoir, the travelogue, the novel, poetry - the contributors approach the topic in diverse and innovative ways. The collection is divided into five sections: 'Peripheral Cultures', dealing with dislocation and imagined landscapes'; 'Memory and Mobility', concerning the road as the scene of trauma and movement; 'Suburbs and Estates', contrasting American and English spaces; 'Literature and Place', foregrounding the fluidity of the fictional and the real and the human and nonhuman; and finally, 'Sensescapes', tracing the sensory response to landscape. Taken together, the essays interrogate important issues about how we live now and might live in the future.

Title:  Molecular biology  
Abstract: Optogenetics is a technique exploded in the last 10 years, which revolutionized several areas of biological research. The brightest side of this technology is the use of light to modulate non-invasively, with high spatial resolution and millisecond time scale, excitable cells genetically modified to express light-sensitive microbial ion channels (opsins). Neuroscience has first benefited from such fascinating strategy, in intact organisms. By shining light to specific neuronal subpopulations, optogenetics allowed unearth the mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell communication within the context of intact organs, such as the brain, formed by complex neuronal circuits. More recently, scientists looked at optogenetics as a tool to answer some of the questions, remained in the dark, of cardiovascular physiology. In this review, we focus on the application of optogenetics in the study of the heart, a complex multicellular organ, homing different populations of excitable cells, spatially and functionally interconnected. Moving from the first proof-of-principle works, published in 2010, to the present time, we discuss the in vitro and in vivo applications of optogenetics for the study of electrophysiology of the different cardiac cell types, and for the dissection of cellular mechanisms underlying arrhythmias. We also present how molecular biology and technology foster the evolution of cardiac optogenetics, with the aim to further our understanding of fundamental questions in cardiac physiology and pathology. Finally, we confer about the therapeutic potential of such biotechnological strategy for the treatment of heart rhythm disturbances (e.g. cardiac pacing, cardioversion). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title: JFK and de Gaulle
Abstract: At the end of January 1963, France's ambassador to the United States, Hervé Alphand, reported back to Paris on a top-secret American exercise at Camp David that revealed many of the stark differences between the two NATO allies. As Alphand, the Kennedy administration had decided the previous October to include representatives from Britain, France, and West Germany in a three-day series of politico-military simulations of potential conflict scenarios in divided Berlin. A French team took part in a series of strategic, limited conflict, and politico-military simulations from November 23 to 25, 1962, and while Alphand was impressed by the sheer planning and intellectual energy that went into this undertaking, he saw its glaring shortcomings. An exercise that Americans saw as a rational approach to the exigencies of the Cold War, the French found utterly dehumanizing. Intuition was discouraged, hindering creativity, yet the Americans believed that they could employ these methods to foresee every possible outcome during a given crisis--including the Vietnam War. In JFK and de Gaulle, Sean J. McLaughlin delves into the study of interstate Franco-American relations during the Kennedy presidency. He explains how John F. Kennedy came to view France as a world power from his college days at Harvard through to the end of his pre-presidential political career, while also exploring how and why France and the United States disagreed over the proper western strategy for the Vietnam War. McLaughlin also explores how de Gaulle's government made vigilant attempts to convince Kennedy that US military intervention in South Vietnam would backfire horribly; however, Kennedy chose not to heed de Gaulle's advice because he did not take France seriously as a member of the Atlantic alliance--

Title: Antonyms in English
Abstract: The study of antonyms (or 'opposites') in a language can provide important insight into word meaning and discourse structures. This book provides an extensive investigation of antonyms in English and offers an innovative model of how we mentally organize concepts and how we perceive contrasts between them. The authors use corpus and experimental methods to build a theoretical picture of the antonym relation, its status in the mind and its construal in context. Evidence is drawn from natural antonym use in speech and writing, first-language antonym acquisition, and controlled elicitation and judgements of antonym pairs by native speakers. The book also proposes ways in which a greater knowledge of how antonyms work can be applied to the fields of language technology and lexicography--

Title:  Addiction  
Abstract: Objective: The aims of this study are to clarify the state of information regarding opioids for families and what kinds of experiences they had with opioids while the patient was followed as an outpatient and inpatient. Participants: This study was part of a cross-sectional nationwide survey of bereaved families of patients with cancer, namely, the Japan Hospice and Palliative Care Evaluation 2 study. The participants in this study comprised 572 bereaved families who had experienced the death of a family member during the period from January 2008 to December 2009 at 1 of 103 certificated palliative care units. Main Outcome Measures: In response to the question of how much improvement was needed for information regarding opioids, 41% answered improvement is not necessary at all, 43% answered improvement is slightly necessary, 14% answered improvement is necessary, and 2% answered improvement is extremely necessary. Regarding anxiety about the use of opioid, it was found that 14% of respondents indicated opioids are very safe, 65% of respondents indicated opioids are relatively safe, 19% of respondents indicated opioids are not so safe, and 2% of respondents indicated opioids are not so safe at all. from the information obtained for opioids. It was found that 90% of families agreed with the item, I would like to be clearly explained that drugs for medical purposes are safe and that the patient will not develop a drug addiction and their life expectancy will not be reduced. Conclusion: From this study, it is important for families of patients with cancer to be explained profound and careful information of opioid.

Title:  Immunology  
Abstract: Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced skin swelling response is widely used as a rough surrogate of integrative cell-mediated and innate immunity across multiple vertebrate taxa due to its simplification and feasibility. However, little is known whether there are sex and interspecific differences of immune responsiveness to PHA in ectotherms, especially for anurans. Therefore, we studied sex and species differences of PHA response in three anurans, Asiatic toads (Bufo gargarizans), Dark-spotted frogs (Pelophylax nigromaculatus) and Mongolian toads (Pseudepidalea raddei), captured in northern regions of Anhui Province (China). Footpad thickness was measured prior to (0 h) and after (6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h) a PHA injection and normalized against saline injection in the opposite footpad. Body mass was recorded at the beginning (0 h) and end of each assay (72 h). Results showed effects of PHA assay, sex and taxa on body mass. Relative maximum swelling response (PHA(max)) ranged from 18.58-29.75%, 9.77 to 20.56% and 21.97 to 31.78% and its occurrence over time was apparent 10.6-19.72 h, 7.74-14.01 h and 17.39-23.94 h postinjection for Asiatic toads, Dark-spotted frogs and Mongolian toads, respectively. Finally, the magnitude or timing of PHAmax in Dark-spotted frogs was significantly thinner and faster than in Mongolian toads, and Asiatic toads had an in-between value, not different from the other two species. The magnitude of PHA(max) was significantly positively correlated with the timing ofPHAmax considering individuals altogether, but not when analyzed within species. Our results indicate that male and female anuran species respond similarly to PHA antigen stimulation, but the magnitude and timing of PHAmax is species-specific. Briefly, we provide new evidence for the suitability of PHA assay in non-model anuran species with different body sizes, and exhort the need to further investigate the nature of PHA assay at the hematological and histological levels in order to extend its application in ecoimmunological studies of amphibians.

Title:  Weight Loss  
Abstract: BCL11B is a zinc finger-type transcription factor that regulates the development of the white adipose tissue (WAT), skin, central nervous system, and immune system. BCL11B is required for proper adipocyte differentiation, and BCL11B-/- embryos at E19.5 have very low amounts of the subcutaneous WAT. Here, we demonstrated that BCL11B+/- mice have lower body weight than BCL11B+/+ mice, whereas the expression of adipogenic marker genes in the WAT was comparable between BCL11B+/+ and BCL11B+/- mice. Histological analysis indicated that BCL11B+/- mice fed a high-fat diet have much smaller white adipocytes and lipid droplets in the WAT and liver, respectively. In addition, BCL11B+/- mice had increased energy consumption under both standard and high-fat diets. Thus, this study identifies BCL11B as a regulator of energy metabolism, and it is unlikely that BCL11B functions in the WAT contribute to energy metabolism in BCL11B+/- mice.

Title:  Distributed computing  
Abstract: At present MapReduce computing model-based Hadoop framework has gradually become the most famous distributed computing framework because of its remarkable features such as scalability, fault tolerance, data security, and powerful IO ability. However, Hadoop framework only supports limited load balancing policies, which may result in performance deterioration in heterogeneous clusters. Additionally Hadoop does not have advanced dynamic load balancing mechanism in enabling its optimal performance in dynamic environment. This paper presents a sliding window-based dynamic load balancing algorithm, which specially aims at balancing the load among the heterogeneous nodes during the Hadoop job processing. The presented algorithm is evaluated in both simulated and physical environments. The experimental results show that the performances in terms of efficiency of Hadoop cluster can be significantly improved. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title:  Northern blotting  
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulation in toxic responses. In the present study, we used two rat models to investigate mRNA translation in the liver following xenobiotic-induced toxicity. By combining polysome profiling with genomic methodologies, we were able to assess global changes in hepatic mRNA translation. Dio3 (iodothyronine deiodinase type III) was identified as a gene that exhibited specific translational repression and had a functional role in a number of relevant canonical pathways. Western blot analysis indicated that this repression led to reduced D3 (the protein expressed by Dio3) levels, enhanced over time and with increased dose. Using Northern blotting techniques and qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR), we confirmed further that there was no reduction in Dio3 mRNA, suggesting that translational repression of Dio3 is an important determinant of the reduced D3 protein expression following liver damage. Finally, we show that drug-induced hepatotoxicity appears to cause localized disruptions in thyroid hormone levels in the liver and plasma. We suggest that this leads to reduced translation of Dio3 mRNA, which results in decreased D3 production. It may therefore be possible that this is an important mechanism by which the liver can, upon early signs of damage, act rapidly to maintain its own energy equilibrium, thereby avoiding global disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

Title: Zürich - Milano 
Abstract: This publication highlights the era between 1948 and 1970 as a turning pont for Swiss graphic artists, especially those stationed in Milan, as well as other great moments in design history. Equipped with an education that was not available in Italy at the time, Swiss graphic artists had an optimistic and undogmatic attitude that was inspiring and new. Italy's path to highly acclaimed visual communication was marked by a profound transalpine dialogue and Milan's reputation as a city for which it was worth leaving behind one's homeland. This publication brings together two icons of poster history, Max Huber and Walter Ballmer.

Title: Samuel Johnson in context 
Abstract: Few authors benefit from being set in their contemporary context more than Samuel Johnson. Samuel Johnson in Context is a guide to his world, offering readers a comprehensive account of eighteenth-century life and culture as it relates to his work. Short, lively and eminently readable chapters illuminate not only Johnson's own life, writings and career, but the literary, critical, journalistic, social, political, scientific, artistic, medical and financial contexts in which his works came into being. Written by leading experts in Johnson and in eighteenth-century studies, these chapters offer both depth and range of information and suggestions for further study and research. Richly illustrated, with a chronology of Johnson's life and works and an extensive bibliography, this book is a major new work of reference on eighteenth-century culture and the age of Johnson--

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Title:  Nonverbal communication  
Abstract: Background: There is limited evidence to support the use of facemasks in preventing infection for primary care professionals. Negative effects on communication has been suggested when the physician wears a facemask. As communication skills and doctor patient relationship are essential to primary care consultations, the effects of doctor's facemask wearing were explored. Method: A randomised controlled study was conducted in primary care to explore the effects of doctors wearing facemasks on patients' perception of doctors' empathy, patient enablement and patient satisfaction. Primary care doctors were randomized to mask wearing and non mask wearing clinical consultations in public primary care clinics in Hong Kong. Patients' views were gathered using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure, Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) and an overall satisfaction rating scale. The effects of face mask wearing were investigated using multilevel (hierarchical) modelling. Results: 1,030 patients were randomised to doctor-mask wearing consultations (n = 514) and non mask wearing consultations (n = 516). A significant and negative effect was found in the patients' perception of the doctors' empathy (CARE score reduction -0.98, p-value = 0.04). In the more established doctor-patient relationship, the effect of doctors' mask wearing was more pronounced (CARE score reduction -5.67, p-value = 0.03). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that when doctors wearing a facemask during consultations, this has a significant negative impact on the patient's perceived empathy and diminish the positive effects of relational continuity. Consideration should be taken in planning appropriate use of facemasks in infectious disease policy for primary care and other healthcare professionals at a national, local or practice level.

Abstract: Optical receivers used in WDM networks are often preceeded by nn optical amplifier to ensure good receiver sensitivity. In this letter, we present an experimental investigation of homowavelength crosstalk in optically preamplified systems using an IM/DD transmission scheme. As a light source, a DFB laser is modulated either directly or externally by an electrical generator. Performance comparisons for both modulation schemes are given to show the influences of noise contribution of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title:  Electrical generator  
Abstract: This paper presents the optimal design of an electromagnetic vibration-based generator using the simulated annealing method (SA). To optimally extract the vibrational energy of a system vibrating at a specific frequency, the selected mass and spring stiffness of a resonant vibration is required. The relationship between induced energy and the generator's structure, its permanent magnet height and diameter, number of turns, and wire diameter in a single air coil are discussed. Also, a prototype of the vibration-based electrical generator is built and tested via a shaker excited at resonance frequency and input amplitude of 0.06mm. Consequently, results reveal that the design parameters (permanent magnet height and diameter, number of turns, and wire diameter) play essential roles in maximizing electrical power.

Title:  Manufacturing engineering  
Abstract: Vibrational comfort is one of the most important parameters evaluated by cyclists during bicycle riding. A method for measuring the saddle vibration transmissibility was developed with the aim of comparing the comfort properties of bicycle saddles without any influence of the full bicycle frame, using a quantitative approach. Three different bicycle saddles were mounted on a stiff seatpost clamped to the extremity of a vertical servohydraulic cylinder: saddles were loaded by a UNI 10814 standard wooden dummy bottom carrying deadweights. After applying a sinusoidal sweep of 0.6mm amplitude to the cylinder, from 1 to 100 Hz, with steps of 2.5 Hz, the application of two piezoelectric accelerometers allowed evaluating the magnitude of the transfer function H between the input acceleration at the cylinder shaft and the output acceleration at the dummy, in the range 1-100 Hz. The three curves of the transfer function magnitude were compared and analyzed in order to introduce a Vibrational Comfort Index and to rank the tested saddles from the engineering quantitative point of view.

Title:  Enzymology  
Abstract: The VATER/VACTERL association describes the combination of congenital anomalies including vertebral defects, anorectal malformations, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula with or without esophageal atresia, renal malformations, and limb defects. As mutations in ciliary genes were observed in diseases related to VATER/VACTERL, we performed targeted resequencing of 25 ciliary candidate genes as well as disease-associated genes (FOXF1, HOXD13, PTEN, ZIC3) in 123 patients with VATER/VACTERL or VATER/VACTERL-like phenotype. We detected no biallelic mutation in any of the 25 ciliary candidate genes; however, identified an identical, probably disease-causing ZIC3 missense mutation (p.Gly17Cys) in four patients and a FOXF1 de novo mutation (p.Gly220Cys) in a further patient. In situ hybridization analyses in mouse embryos between E9.5 and E14.5 revealed Zic3 expression in limb and prevertebral structures, and Foxf1 expression in esophageal, tracheal, vertebral, anal, and genital tubercle tissues, hence VATER/VACTERL organ systems. These data provide strong evidence that mutations in ZIC3 or FOXF1 contribute to VATER/VACTERL. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Maimonides' guide of the perplexed
Abstract: Moses Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed (c. 1190) is the greatest and most influential text in the history of Jewish philosophy. Controversial in its day, the Guide directly influenced Aquinas, Spinoza, and Leibniz, and the history of Jewish philosophy took a decisive turn after its appearance. While there continues to be keen interest in Maimonides and his philosophy, this is the first scholarly collection in English devoted specifically to the Guide. It includes contributions from an international team of scholars addressing the most important philosophical themes that range over the three parts of this sprawling work - including topics in the philosophy of language, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of law, ethics, and political philosophy. There are also essays on the Guide's hermeneutic puzzles, and on its overall structure and philosophical trajectory. The volume will be of interest to philosophers, Judaists, theologians, and medievalists

Title:  Construction Management  
Abstract: As building information modeling (BIM) systems continue to be widely adopted, there is an increasing demand for an active construction schedule management system with more advanced decision-making capabilities. For example, if overlapping between construction activities is significant, the performance of construction operations for the corresponding activities may deteriorate. Thus, a viable construction schedule should be formulated in order to minimize overlapping of proximate construction activities. An active system can be regarded as a certain solution for this issue. The purpose of this study is to develop a systematic methodology and computer system for an optimal construction schedule simulation that minimize overlapping activities for the enhancement of a project's operational performance. This study centers on identifying overlapping activities, applying fuzzy theory, and analyzing risk levels for schedule overlap issues. In addition, genetic algorithm (GA) theory is adopted for the minimization of the overlapping of highly risky activities. Finally, an optimal construction schedule that minimizes overlapping activities is suggested. The optimal schedule is visualized in a BIM-based four-dimensional (4D) computer-aided design (CAD) environment. The 4D CAD system developed in this study includes fuzzy and GA analysis functions with a schedule simulator. A case study on an actual project is introduced to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Title: Dialects of English
Abstract: This collection consists of 15 articles by an international group of linguists and 7 essays by the editors, tackling a broad range of issues and representing some of the most authoritative work in English dialect grammar.Individual chapters cover the full international range of English dialects, from the centre of Sydney to the shores of Newfoundland, and from the Scottish borders to the Appalachian Mountains. Soundly based on empirical research, they are rich in data of great interest in itself, but no article is merely descriptive. The editors have selected papers for their value in contributing to the reader's broader understanding of the theoretical issues concerning dialectology as a whole. As a result, dialectology is presented as a major scholarly discipline drawing creatively on such areas as linguistics, sociology, psychology, history, geography and even philosophy. These and other themes are explored in a wide-ranging Introduction by the editors, which sets the individual pieces and the subject in context for the reader.

Title:  Image processing  
Abstract: Cracks are formed during the drying process of spaghetti production, which reduces its commercial value and quality; hence, it is very important to detect the cracks during the manufacturing process of dried spaghetti. However, the presence of mottles, originating from wheat bran, hinders automatic identification of cracks. In this study, we developed a simple method to detect the cracks induced in spaghetti using a digital camera. The cracks and mottles were distinguished by pixelating the transmission light image of the spaghetti and analyzing the image based on the geometric characteristics in the histogram consisting of all the pixels. The method was able to detect the cracks induced in the spaghetti with a rough surface, which was prepared via a bronze die using vacuum extrusion molding, as well as those induced in the spaghetti with a smooth surface, which was prepared using a Teflon die.

Title:  Overactive Bladder  
Abstract: AIMSThe purpose of this study was to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). METHODSPatients with new-onset iNPH were prospectively evaluated for LUTS via detailed history and physical, and administration of questionnaires from the International Consultation on Incontinence to assess incontinence (ICIq-UI), overactive bladder (ICIq-OAB), and quality of life (ICIq-LUTqol), as well as the American Urological Association Symptom Score bother scale. All patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS were offered urodynamic testing. Sub-analysis was performed based on gender, medical comorbidities, and age. RESULTSFifty-five consecutive patients with iNPH completed the initial evaluation and surveys. Total urinary incontinence score was mild to moderate (8.710.64: 0-21 scale) with 90.9% experiencing leakage and 74.5% reporting urge incontinence. The most common OAB symptom was nocturia (2.2 +/- 0.14: 0-4 scale) with urge incontinence the most bothersome (3.71 +/- 0.44: 0-10 scale). Quality-of-life impact was moderate (4.47 +/- 0.4: 0-10 scale) and American Urological Association Symptom Score bother scale was 2.89 +/- 0.22 (0-6 scale). Urodynamics testing revealed 100% detrusor overactivity and mean bladder capacity of 200mL. Several differences were identified based on gender, medical comorbidities, and age. CONCLUSIONSPatients with iNPH present with mild-moderate incontinence of which nocturia is the most common symptom, urge incontinence the most bothersome, with 100% of patients having detrusor overactivity. Younger patients experienced greater bother related to LUTS. To our knowledge, this is the only prospective evaluation of urinary symptoms in patients with new-onset iNPH.

Title:  Irritable Bowel Syndrome  
Abstract: Constipation is one of the most common gastrointestinal complaints worldwide. This study was performed to determine whether Bifidobacterium adolescentis exerts inter-strain differences in alleviating constipation induced by loperamide in BALB/c mice and to analyze the main reasons for these differences. BALB/c mice underwent gavage with B. adolescentis (CCFM 626, 667, and 669) once per day for 17 days. The primary outcome measures included related constipation indicators, and the secondary outcome measures were the basic biological characteristics of the strains, the concentration changes of short-chain fatty acids in feces, and the changes in the fecal flora. B. adolescentis CCFM 669 and 667 relieved constipation symptoms by adhering to intestinal epithelial cells, growing quickly in vitro and increasing the concentrations of propionic and butyric acids. The effect of B. adolescentis on the gut microbiota in mice with constipation was investigated via 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis. The results revealed that the relative abundance of Lactobacillus increased and the amount of Clostridium decreased in the B. adolescentis CCFM 669 and 667 treatment groups. In conclusion, B. adolescentis exhibits strain-specific effects in the alleviation of constipation, mostly due to the strains' growth rates, adhesive capacity and effects on the gut microbiome and microenvironment.

Title:  Human Metabolism  
Abstract: Selenium is an essential micronutrient to human metabolism and it has been demonstrated that it has a marked antioxidant effect. In its inorganic form, selenium can be potentially toxic for human health, while its availability increases in its organic form and its toxicity declines. Inorganic selenium is incorporated in some lactic acid bacteria, which are commonly used as starter in fermented dairy products. The aim of this research was to determine and quantify the capacity of selenium incorporation in Lactobacillus ssp. metabolism, by ICE Culture media were enriched with Na2SeO3 in order to determine such capacity. Four lactic acid. bacteria were used and their tolerance to selenium was determined by adding Na2SeO3 to growth medium. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GO presented the highest tolerance (198 mg/L). Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCFB2772 showed the lowest assimilation of inorganic selenium (9.14%) while L. helveticus IUAMI70129 had the highest (76.50%) despite being the microorganism which displayed the least tolerance (43 mg/L). On the other hand, Lactobacillus jhonsonii showed the highest concentration of selenium in terms of generated biomass weight (0.91 mu g/mg). Finally, all bacteria under study assimilated inorganic selenium. Therefore, they could be used as starter cultures or as functional ingredients, for elaboration of foods enriched with selenium.

Title: After sound
Abstract: After Sound considers contemporary art practices that reconceive music beyond the limitation of sound. This book is called After Sound because music and sound are, in Barrett's account, different entities. While musicology and sound art theory alike typically equate music with pure instrumental sound, or absolute music, Barrett posits music as an expanded field of artistic practice encompassing a range of different media and symbolic relationships. The works discussed in After Sound thus use performance, text scores, musical automata, video, social practice, and installation while they articulate a novel aesthetic space for a radically engaged musical practice. Coining the term critical music, this book examines a diverse collection of art projects which intervene into specific political and philosophical conflicts by exploring music's unique historical forms.

Title: The confidence trap
Abstract: Why do democracies keep lurching from success to failure? The current financial crisis is just the latest example of how things continue to go wrong, just when it looked like they were going right. In this wide-ranging, original, and compelling book, David Runciman tells the story of modern democracy through the history of moments of crisis, from the First World War to the economic crash of 2008. A global history with a special focus on the United States, The Confidence Trap examines how democracy survived threats ranging from the Great Depression to the Cuban missile crisis, and from Watergate to the collapse of Lehman Brothers. It also looks at the confusion and uncertainty created by unexpected victories, from the defeat of German autocracy in 1918 to the defeat of communism in 1989. Throughout, the book pays close attention to the politicians and thinkers who grappled with these crises: from Woodrow Wilson, Nehru, and Adenauer to Fukuyama and Obama.The Confidence Trap shows that democracies are good at recovering from emergencies but bad at avoiding them. The lesson democracies tend to learn from their mistakes is that they can survive them--and that no crisis is as bad as it seems. Breeding complacency rather than wisdom, crises lead to the dangerous belief that democracies can muddle through anything--a confidence trap that may lead to a crisis that is just too big to escape, if it hasn't already. The most serious challenges confronting democracy today are debt, the war on terror, the rise of China, and climate change. If democracy is to survive them, it must figure out a way to break the confidence trap--

Title:  Rheumatoid Arthritis  
Abstract: Calprotectin is a heterodimer formed by two proteins, S100A8 and S100A9, which are mainly produced by activated monocytes and neutrophils in the circulation and in inflamed tissues. The implication of calprotectin in the inflammatory process has already been demonstrated, but its role in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and monitoring of rheumatic diseases has gained great attention in recent years. Calprotectin, being stable at room temperature, is a candidate biomarker for the follow-up of disease activity in many autoimmune disorders, where it can predict response to treatment or disease relapse. There is evidence that a number of immunomodulators, including TNF-alpha inhibitors, may reduce calprotectin expression. S100A8 and S100A9 have a potential role as a target of treatment in murine models of autoimmune disorders, since the direct or indirect blockade of these proteins results in amelioration of the disease process. In this review, we will go over the biologic functions of calprotectin which might be involved in the etiology of rheumatic disorders. We will also report evidence of its potential use as a disease biomarker.

Title: The hero with a thousand faces 
Abstract: Since its release in 1949, The Hero with a Thousand Faces has influenced millions of readers by combining the insights of modern psychology with Joseph Campbell's revolutionary understanding of comparative mythology. In these pages, Campbell outlines the Hero's Journey, a universal motif of adventure and transformation that runs through virtually all of the world's mythic traditions. He also explores the Cosmogonic Cycle, the mythic pattern of world creation and destruction. As part of the Joseph Campbell Foundation's Collected Works of Joseph Campbell, this third edition features expanded illustrations, a comprehensive bibliography, and more accessible sidebars. As relevant today as when it was first published, The Hero with a Thousand Faces continues to find new audiences in fields ranging from religion and anthropology to literature and film studies. The book has also profoundly influenced creative artists--including authors, songwriters, game designers, and filmmakers--and continues to inspire all those interested in the inherent human need to tell stories.

Title:  Operating systems  
Abstract: The widespread distribution of smart mobile devices offers promising perspectives for the timely collection of huge amounts of data. When realizing sophisticated mobile data collection applications, numerous technical issues arise. For example, as many real-world projects require the support of different mobile operating systems, platform-specific peculiarities must be properly handled. Existing approaches often rely on specifically tailored mobile applications. As a drawback, changes to the data collection procedure result in costly code adaptations. To remedy this drawback, a model-driven approach is proposed, enabling end-users (i.e.,domain experts) to create mobile data collection applications themselves. This model relies on complex questionnaires called instruments. An instrument not only contains all information about the data to be collected, but additionally comprises information on how it shall be processed on different mobile operating systems. For this purpose, we developed an advanced mobile (kernel) service being capable of processing sophisticated instruments on various platforms. This paper discusses fundamental kernel requirements and introduces the developed architecture. Altogether, the mobile service allows for the effective use of smart mobile devices in data collection application scenarios (e.g., clinical trials).

Title: Essentials of pattern recognition
Abstract: This textbook introduces fundamental concepts, major models, and popular applications of pattern recognition for a one-semester undergraduate course. To ensure student understanding, the text focuses on a relatively small number of core concepts with an abundance of illustrations and examples. Concepts are reinforced with hands-on exercises to nurture the student's skill in problem solving. New concepts and algorithms are framed by real-world context and established as part of the big picture introduced in an early chapter. A problem-solving strategy is employed in several chapters to equip students with an approach for new problems in pattern recognition. This text also points out common errors that a new player in pattern recognition may encounter, and fosters the ability for readers to find useful resources and independently solve a new pattern recognition task through various working examples. Students with an undergraduate understanding of mathematical analysis, linear algebra, and probability will be well prepared to master the concepts and mathematical analysis presented here.--Provided by publisher.

Title: Contemporary Greek film cultures from 1990 to the present 
Abstract: This collection of new writing on contemporary Greek cinema builds and expands on existing work in the field, providing a coherent analysis of films which, despite their international importance, have so far received limited critical attention. The volume maps key trends in Greek cinema since the 1990s within the wider context of production and consumption at both national and international levels. It offers a wide range of critical analyses of documentary and avant-garde filmmaking, art house and popular cinema, and the work of established and new directors as well as deliberations on teaching methodologies and marketing strategies. The book seeks to highlight the continuities, mutual influences and common contexts that inform, shape and inspire filmmaking in Greece today.

Title: Autobiography as a writing strategy in postcolonial literature 
Abstract: Autobiography, a fully-recognised genre within mainstream literature today, has evolved massively in the last few decades, particularly through colonial and postcolonial texts. By using autobiography as a means of expression, many postcolonial writers were able to describe their experiences in the face of the denial of personal expression for centuries. This book is centred around the recounting and analysis of such a phenomenon.Literary purists often reject autobiography as a fully-fledged literary genre, perceiving it rather as a mere life report or a descriptive diary. The colonial and postcolonial autobiographical texts analysed in this book refute such perceptions, and demonstrate a subtle combination of literary qualities and the recounting of real-life experiences.This book demonstrates that colonial and postcolonial autobiographical texts have established their `literarity'. The need for postcolonial authors to express themselves through the `I' and the `me', as subjects and not as objects, is the essence of this book, and confirms that self-affirmation through autobiographical writing is indeed an art form.

Title:  Child abuse  
Abstract: With government's response to child abuse and neglect seen as one of the most daunting challenges for public policy and law, legislative reform on this issue struggles to adequately protect children while preserving the integrity of family. The authors utilize the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) as an example of the funding and policy challenges in reforming federal child welfare law, as well as a lens through which advocates can locate both conventional and unconventional tools to move forward. CAPTA is examined as an important but weak and flawed federal statute. Authors present an array of opportunities to improve CAPTA during the next reauthorization cycle. Noting exemplary successes, in other recent and related legislation reforms, are suggested for CAPTA to more effectively address ongoing challenges of child welfare.

Title:  Machine learning  
Abstract: A substantial amount of datasets stored for various applications are often high dimensional with redundant and irrelevant features. Processing and analysing data under such circumstances is time consuming and makes it difficult to obtain efficient predictive models. There is a strong need to carry out analyses for high dimensional data in some lower dimensions, and one approach to achieve this is through feature selection. This paper presents a new relevancy-redundancy approach, called the maximum relevance minimum multicollinearity (MRmMC) method, for feature selection and ranking, which can overcome some shortcomings of existing criteria. In the proposed method, relevant features are measured by correlation characteristics based on conditional variance while redundancy elimination is achieved according to multiple correlation assessment using an orthogonal projection scheme. A series of experiments were conducted on eight datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and results show that the proposed method performed reasonably well for feature subset selection.

Title:  Suspension Bridge  
Abstract: Precast hollow core slabs (HCS) are technically advanced products in the precast concrete industry, widely used in the last years due to their versatility, their multipurpose potential and their low cost. Using three dimensional FEM (Finite Element Method) elements, this study focuses on the stresses induced by the prestressing of steel. In particular the investigation of the spalling crack formation that takes place during prestressing is carried out, since it is important to assure the appropriate necessary margins concerning such stresses. In fact, spalling cracks may spread rapidly towards the web, leading to the detachment of the lower part of the slab. A parametric study takes place, capable of evaluating the influence of the tendon position and of the web width on the spalling stress. Consequently, after an extensive literature review on the topic of soft computing, an optimization of the HCS is performed by means of Genetic Algorithms coupled with 3-D FEM models.

Title: Scale
Abstract: From one of the most influential scientists of our time, a dazzling exploration of the hidden laws that govern the life cycle of everything from plants and animals to the cities we live in. The former head of the Sante Fe Institute, visionary physicist Geoffrey West is a pioneer in the field of complexity science, the science of emergent systems and networks. The term complexity can be misleading, however, because what makes West's discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that unites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our businesses. Fascinated by issues of aging and mortality, West applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of why we live as long as we do and no longer. The result was astonishing, and changed science, creating a new understanding of energy use and metabolism: West found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of mammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. If you know the size of a mammal, you can use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it will take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. Furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal's circulatory systems scales up precisely based on weight: if you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, you find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25% more efficient--and lives 25% longer. This speaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need. Fundamentally, he has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove waste from the organism's body--

Title:  Person perception  
Abstract: Social cognition is fundamentally interpersonal: individuals' behaviour and dispositions critically affect their interaction partners' information processing. However, cognitive neuroscience studies, partially because of methodological constraints, have remained largely ""perceiver-centric"": focusing on the abilities, motivations, and goals of social perceivers while largely ignoring interpersonal effects. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the neural bases of perceiving emotionally expressive and inexpressive social ""targets."" Sixteen perceivers were scanned using fMRI while they watched targets discussing emotional autobiographical events. Perceivers continuously rated each target's emotional state or eye-gaze direction. The effects of targets' emotional expressivity on perceiver's brain activity depended on task set: when perceivers explicity attended to targets' emotions, expressivity predicted activity in neural structures-including medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex-associated with drawing inferences about mental states. When perceivers instead attended to targets' eye-gaze, target expressivity predicted activity in regions-including somatosensory cortex, fusiform gyrus, and motor cortex-associated with monitoring sensorimotor states and biological motion. These findings suggest that expressive targets affect information processing in manner that depends on perceivers' goals. More broadly, these data provide an early step toward understanding the neural bases of interpersonal social cognition.

Abstract: A backward and forward coupled ring transmission line all-pass phasers are presented, and their general characteristics, operation principles and typical group characteristics are discussed using ideal circuit simulations. The first configuration is based on contra-directional ( backward) coupling, which is perfectly TEM, while the second configuration is based on non-TEM co-directional ( forward) coupling, which is the radiofrequency counterpart of the optical ring resonator coupling. Compared to conventional end-connected coupled-line phasers, the group delay swings of the proposed phasers are inversely proportional to the involved coupling coefficients. They thus represent practically promising devices for high-resolution realtime radio.

Title:  Gender roles  
Abstract: Early childhood educators' (ECE) perceptions of gender roles may contribute to the development of children's own gender-role identities. This qualitative study examined 40 Canadian female ECEs' perceptions of gender and children's shy, aggressive, and prosocial behaviors. Content analysis of extensive interviews revealed three themes: (1) shyness as personality based, (2) influences on the behaviors, and (3) teachers' role in addressing gender and behavior. Most ECEs believed that shyness is a personality trait, exhibited equally among both genders, but displayed differently. In contrast, there were some inconsistencies as to which gender was perceived by the participants as more aggressive or prosocial. As well, findings suggested that participants believed that a teacher's role was to address behaviors within the classroom, and to help children express and understand their feelings through discussion and educational aids (e.g., books, videos, and community examples). Results are discussed in terms of educational implications and ECE training.

Title: Imagination and adolescent trauma
Abstract: Exploring the role of imagination in trauma recovery, the author shares the arresting dreams and stories of traumatized adolescents. Describing the impact of trauma on adolescent health and development, the author provides promising research into the use of breathing skills, HRV Biofeedback, and dream work to promote healthy breathing, emotion regulation, and restorative dreaming. Research suggests that these interventions can decrease post-traumatic distress and assist in the creation of meaningful posttraumatic narratives. The author explores the role of embodied imagination in adolescent spiritual development and posttraumatic growth. These interventions provide clinicians and pastoral caregivers with simple and effective ways of helping adolescents heal from trauma in holistic and dynamic ways that respect the integrated constitution of the human person.

Title:  Migraine  
Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to determine the plasma levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and visfatin in different stages and different subtypes of migraine headaches compared to a control group to elucidate the pathological mechanisms involved. Material/Methods: We recruited a case-control cohort of 182 adult migraine patients and 80 age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls. The migraine patients were divided into two groups: the headache-attack-period group (Group A, n=77) and the headache-free-period group (Group B, n=105). The two groups were further divided into subgroups according to whether they had aura symptoms. Solid phase double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the plasma levels of COX-2 and visfatin. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0. Results: The plasma levels of COX-2 and visfatin in the headache-attack-period group were significantly higher than in the headache-free-period group and the control group; there were no significant differences between the headache-free group and the control group. There were no significant differences in plasma levels of COX-2 and visfatin between the subgroups: headache-attack-period with aura subgroup and the headache-attack-period without aura sub group. Conclusions: COX-2 and visfatin participated in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches. The presence of aura had no effect on the serum levels of COX-2 and visfatin.

Title: Jean-Louis Deniot, interiors 
Abstract: The first book on the work of a designer whose refined classical interiors are widely desired and emulated as the epitome of French style. Honored as one of the top designers by all the international design magazines and universally admired by design editors, Jean-Louis Deniot is in demand. His updated classical approach now graces interiors in Paris, the French countryside, Moscow, India, New York, Chicago, L.A., and beyond—and his legacy is already being compared to that of design greats such as Jacques Grange and Alberto Pinto. Deniot is an architect first, ensuring that the interior architecture of his rooms is harmonious before giving a neoclassical approach to the decor. He brings education, logic, and design history to his work, with one eye looking at the most refined style of French eighteenth century and one eye on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. His mix is highly individual and includes contemporary art and custom-made furniture, yet his rooms always look comfortable and are never overly formal or trendy. This book demonstrates a new, sophisticated classical style that is changing the scene for international design and offering inspiration and ideas to decorators, homeowners, and antiques enthusiasts.

Title: Renegotiating the world order
Abstract: Rising powers often seek to reshape the world order, triggering confrontations with those who seek to defend the status quo. In recent years, as international institutions have grown in prevalence and influence, they have increasingly become central arenas for international contestation. Phillip Y. Lipscy examines how international institutions evolve as countries seek to renegotiate the international order. He offers a new theory of institutional change and explains why some institutions change flexibly while others successfully resist or fall to the wayside. The book uses a wealth of empirical evidence - quantitative and qualitative - to evaluate the theory from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, European Union, League of Nations, United Nations, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. The book will be of particular interest to scholars interested in the historical and contemporary diplomacy of the United States, Japan, and China.

Title:  computer-aided design  
Abstract: Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is a new analysis method for unification of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE). With the use of NURBS basis functions for both modelling and analysis, the bottleneck of meshing is avoided and a seamless integration is achieved. The CAD and computational geometry concepts in IGA are new to the analysis community. Though, there is a steady growth of literature, details of calculations, explanations and examples are not reported. The content of the paper is complimentary to the existing literature and addresses the gaps. It includes summary of the literature, overview of the methodology, step-by-step calculations and Matlab codes for example problems in static structural and modal analysis in 1-D and 2-D. At appropriate places, comparison with the Finite Element Analysis (FEM) is also included, so that those familiar with FEM can appreciate IGA better.

Title:  Software engineering  
Abstract: This paper investigates the current automatics methods used to generate efficient and accurate signatures to create countermeasures against attacks by polymorphic worms. These strategies include autograph, polygraph and Simplified Regular Expression (SRE). They rely on network-based signature detection and filtering content network traffic, as the signature generated by these methods can be read by Intrusion Prevention systems and firewalls. In this paper, we also present the architecture and evaluation of each method, and the implementation used as patterns by SRE mechanism to extract accurate signatures. Such implementation was accomplished through use of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which was inadequate to manage the invariant parts and distances restrictions of the polymorphic worm. Consequently, an Enhanced Contiguous Substring Rewarded (ECSR) algorithm is developed to improve the result extraction from the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and generate accurate signatures. The signature generation by SRE is found to be more accurate and efficient as it preserves all the important features of polymorphic worms. The evaluation results show that the signature contains conjunctions of tokens, or token subsequence can produce a loss of vital information such as ignoring one byte token or neglecting the restriction distances. Furthermore, the Simplified Regular Expression needs to be updated and accurate when compared with autograph and polygraph methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Asthma  
Abstract: Background: Secretoglobin family 3A member 2 (SCGB3A2) plays an important role in secreting lung surfactant protein, which is a downstream target of thyroid transcription factor. Material/Methods: We investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SCGB3A2 gene contribute to susceptibility to asthma. To explore this possible association, 2 promoter SNPs (rs6882292, 659 G/A and rs1368408, -112 G/A) and missense SNP (rs151333009, stop codon) were tested in SCGB3A2 gene in 101 asthma patients and 377 healthy control subjects. SNPStats was used to obtain odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and P value adjusted for age and sex as covariables. Logistic regression method in each model (dominant, recessive, and log-additive) was applied to analyze genetic data. Results: rs151333009 SNP showed a monomorphic genotype. Two promoter SNPs (rs6882292, -659 G/A and rs1368408, -112 G/A) showed significant association with asthma (rs6882292, OR=2.66, 95% CI=1.42-5.01, p=0.0033 in dominant model, OR=2.45, 95% CI=1.33-4.54, p=0.0055 in log-additive model; rs1368408, OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.02-2.49, p=0.041 in dominant model, OR=3.02, 95% CI=1.15-7.90, p=0.03 in recessive model, OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.63, 95% CI=1.12-2.37, p=0.012 in log-additive model). Conclusions: These results suggest that the promoter SNPs (rs6882292 and rs1368408) of SCGB3A2 gene may contribute to susceptibility to asthma in a Korean population.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Title:  Depression  
Abstract: Background: An increasing need exists for suitable measures to evaluate treatment outcome in adolescents. YP-CORE is a pan-theoretical brief questionnaire developed for this purpose, but it lacks studies in different cultures or languages.Aims: To explore the acceptability, factor structure, reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the Finnish translation of YP-CORE.Methods: The study was conducted at the Department of Adolescent Psychiatry, Helsinki University Central Hospital. A Finnish translation was prepared by a team of professionals and adolescents. A clinical sample of 104 patients was asked to complete the form together with BDI-21 and BAI, and 92 of them filled the forms again after a 3-month treatment. Analysis included acceptability, confirmatory factor analysis, internal and test-re-test reliability, concurrent validity, influence of gender and age, and criteria for reliable change.Results: YP-CORE was well accepted, and the rate of missing values was low. Internal consistency (=0.83-.92) and test-re-test reliability were good (r=0.69), and the results of CFA supported a one-factor model. YP-CORE showed good concurrent validity against two widely used symptom-specific measures (r=0.62-0.87). Gender had a moderately strong effect on the scores (d=0.67), but the effect of age was not as evident. The measure was sensitive to change, showing a larger effect size (d=0.55) than in the BDI-21 and BAI (d=0.31-0.50).Conclusions: The results show that the translation of YP-CORE into Finnish has been successful, the YP-CORE has good psychometric properties, and the measure could be taken into wider use in clinical settings for outcome measurement in adolescents.

Title:  Stealth Technology  
Abstract: In this contribution we propose an analysis of the absorbing capabilities of planar structures loaded with Left Handed Material (LHM) based on resonant magnetic inclusions, operating at microwave frequencies. To this end, we'll present a general formulation valid for any characteristic property of LHM. It is demonstrated that if a medium with the proposed constitutive properties is achieved, then some of the very common limitations of present day absorbers like the presence of metallic plates can be overcome. It is shown, also, that the introduction of LHM leads to an enlargement of the angular bandwidth with a reduction of the overall dimensions of the component. Numerical results together with some remarks about possible practical implementations of the proposed components will be also given.

Title: Breakthrough strategies
Abstract: Breakthrough Strategies identifies effective strategies that faculty have used to help New Majority students--those from minority, immigrant, or disadvantaged backgrounds--build the necessary skills to succeed in college. As the proportion of New Majority students rises, there is increased attention to helping them gain access to college. Once enrolled, however, these students often face significant challenges of adjustment, with few resources for support. Specifically, there is little attention to students' experiences within their college classrooms and their relationships with professors. At the same time, faculty who work with these students have little guidance in how to help them adjust to new expectations and identities as they engage with college-level work. Sister Kathleen A. Ross, a MacArthur fellow and president emerita of Heritage University, has devoted three decades to helping New Majority students get college degrees. Based on an action-research project undertaken at Heritage University and Yakima Valley Community College in Washington State, the book highlights eleven strategies to encourage student success, including: asking questions in class; navigating the syllabus; and developing an academic identity.--

Title:  Psoriatic Arthritis  
Abstract: Background: Hyperactive secretion and pathogenic effects of interleukin (IL)-17 and IgA have been detected in different arthropathies. Recent evidence has revealed that T(H)17 cytokines regulate mucosal IgA secretion. However, it is unknown whether and how IL-17 mediates synovial IgA production. Here we aim to investigate the connection of synovial IL-17 with IgA production in the joint. In this study we included synovial fluids (SF) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n = 66), spondyloarthritis (SpA; n = 18) and osteoarthritis (OA; n = 36). The levels of IL-17, IL-6, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1), B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) and anti-lipopolyssacharide (LPS) immunoglobulin (Ig)A were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Total IgA was measured by radial immunodiffusion assay. Synovial fluid-derived mononuclear cells (SFMC) were stimulated with bacterial antigens or SF-conditioned media, and cytokines and IgA were analyzed in the supernatants. Results: IL-17, IL-6 and TGF-beta(1) were increased in SF from both RA and SpA compared with OA patients. Concentration of IL-17 correlated with the disease activity score (DAS)-28, IL-6 and anti-LPS IgA levels. Bacterial-stimulated SFMCs from RA and SpA patients secreted higher IL-17 than vehicle-stimulated SFMCs. Conditioned media with SF containing IL-17 induced anti-LPS IgA production by SFMCs which was independent of IL-6 activity. Concentrations of synovial TGF-beta(1) and BAFF correlated with anti-LPS and total IgA levels, respectively. Blockade of IL-17 decreased the production of TGF-beta(1) and anti-LPS IgA by SF-stimulated SFMCs. Conclusions: This study reports a connection between IL-17 and IgA secretion in the joint. In addition, it demonstrates that enterobacterial antigens trigger synovial IL-17 production, and that TGF-beta(1) and BAFF may mediate the effect of IL-17 on IgA production. This circuit may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint diseases.

Title:  Enzymology  
Abstract: Polyketides are structurally and functionally diverse secondary metabolites that are biosynthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) using acyl-CoA precursors. Recent studies in the engineering and structural characterization of PKSs have facilitated the use of target enzymes as biocatalysts to produce novel functionally optimized polyketides. These compounds may serve as potential drug leads. This review summarizes the insights gained from research on type III PKSs, from the discovery of chalcone synthase in plants to novel PKSs in bacteria and fungi. To date, at least 15 families of type III PKSs have been characterized, highlighting the utility of PKSs in the development of natural product libraries for therapeutic development.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Title:  Sprains and Strains  
Abstract: This study examined the effect of the HamSprint Drills training programme and conventional football practice warm-up on Lower Limb neuromuscular control. The purpose-built active movement extent discrimination apparatus was used to assess lower limb neuromuscular control in 29 footballers from one professional Australian Football League club. Without vision of the contact point, participants performed 40 backward swing movement trials with each leg and made a judgment of the magnitude of each movement. Scores representing the ability to discriminate between different movement extents were calculated as the area under the player's receiver operating characteristic curve, constructed using non-parametric signal detection theory methods. Participants were randomized to either an intervention or control group that performed different procedures in the warm-up prior to football practice sessions over a 6-week period, and then were re-tested. The intervention group performed the HamSprint programme-drills specific to the improvement of running technique, co-ordination and hamstring function. The control group performed their usual warm-up of stretching, running, and increasingly intense football drills. Backward leg swing extent discrimination was significantly better in players following the 6-week HamSprint programme when compared to discrimination scores of players who performed their usual practice warm-up only. Significant improvement was observed in lower limb neuromuscular control in movements similar to the late-swing early stance phase of running. The HamSprint programme can therefore improve control in a specific aspect of sensorimotor system performance, and this may be useful particularly in athletes who have lower function levels or those deemed at risk of hamstring injury.

Title: Swift and others 
Abstract: Jonathan Swift's influence on the writings and politics of England and Ireland was reinforced by a combination of contradictory forces: an authoritarian attachment to tradition and rule, and a vivid responsiveness to the disorders of a modernity he resisted and yet helped to create. He was, perhaps even more than Pope, a dominant voice of his times. The rich variety of the literary culture to which he belonged shows the penetration of his ideas, personality and style. This is true of writers who were his friends and admirers (Pope), of adversaries (Mandeville, Johnson), of several who became great ironists in his shadow (Gibbon, Austen), and of some surprising examples of Swiftian afterlife (Chatterton). Claude Rawson, leading scholar of the works of Swift, brings together recent essays, as well as classic earlier work extensively revised, to offer fresh insights into an era when Swift's voice was a pervasive presence--

Title: Li Po and Tu Fu 
Abstract: Li Po (AD 701-62) and Tu Fu (AD 712-70) were devoted friends who are traditionally considered to be among China's greatest poets. Li Po, a legendary carouser, was an itinerant poet whose writing, often dream poems or spirit-journeys, soars to sublime heights in its descriptions of natural scenes and powerful emotions. His sheer escapism and joy is balanced by Tu Fu, who expresses the Confucian virtues of humanity and humility in more autobiographical works that are imbued with great compassion and earthy reality, and shot through with humour. Together these two poets of the T'ang dynasty complement each other so well that they often came to be spoken of as one - 'Li-Tu' - who covers the whole spectrum of human life, experience and feeling.

Title: The power of color
Abstract: This expansive study of color illuminates the substance, context, and meaning of five centuries of European painting. Between the mid-15th and the mid-19th centuries, the materials of painting remained remarkably unchanged, but innovations in their use flourished. Technical discoveries facilitated new visual effects, political conditions prompted innovations, and economic changes shaped artists' strategies, especially as trade became global. Marcia Hall explores how Michelangelo radically broke with his contemporaries' harmonizing use of color in favor of a highly saturated approach; how the robust art market and demand for affordable pictures in 17th-century Netherlands helped popularize subtly colored landscape paintings; how politics and color became entangled during the French Revolution; and how modern artists liberated color from representation as their own role transformed from manipulators of pigments to visionaries celebrated for their individual expression. Using insights from recent conservation studies, Hall captivates readers with fascinating details and developments in magnificent examples-from Botticelli and Titian to Van Gogh and Kandinsky-to weave an engaging analysis. Her insistence on the importance of examining technique and material to understand artistic meaning gives readers the tools to look at these paintings with fresh eyes.

Title:  Hepatitis C  
Abstract: T-cell host immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been suggested to play an important role in determining HCV infection outcome. However, data from human studies are not available. This study examined the effect of primary T-cell deficiency along with other factors on the spontaneous clearance of HCV in a large population-based cohort in British Columbia, Canada. The BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort includes all individuals tested for HCV in BC in 1990-2013 linked with data on their medical visits, hospitalizations and prescription drugs. HCV-positive individuals with at least one valid HCV PCR test on/after HCV diagnosis (n=46783) were included in this study. To examine factors associated with the spontaneous clearance of HCV, multivariable logistic regression was fitted on the full sample, and Cox proportional hazards model on the HCV seroconverters. Spontaneous clearance was observed in 25.1% (n=11737) of those tested for HCV. After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of spontaneous clearance of HCV was lower in people with primary T-cell immunodeficiency (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.94), and higher in females (aOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.54-1.68) and in those coinfected with HBV (aOR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.93-2.77). Similar results were observed in HCV seroconverters except HBV coinfection was not significant. In conclusion, primary T-cell immunodeficiency is associated with a lower spontaneous clearance of HCV while female sex and coinfection with HBV are associated with a higher spontaneous clearance.

Title:  Fungal Infection  
Abstract: Background: There are a number of different manifestations of pulmonary aspergillosis. This study aims to review the radiology, presentation, and histological features of lung nodules caused by Aspergillus spp. Methods: Patients were identified from a cohort attending our specialist Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis clinic. Patients with cavitating lung lesions, with or without fibrosis and those with aspergillomas or a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis were excluded. Demographic, laboratory, and clinical data and radiologic findings were recorded. Results: Thirty-three patients with pulmonary nodules and diagnostic features of aspergillosis (histology and/or laboratory findings) were identified. Eighteen (54.5 %) were male, mean age 58 years (range 27-80 years). 19 (57.6 %) were former or current smokers. The median Charleston co-morbidity index was 3 (range 0-7). All complained of a least one of; dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, or weight loss. None reported fever. Ten patients (31 %) did not have an elevated Aspergillus IgG, and only 4 patients had elevated Aspergillus precipitins. Twelve patients (36 %) had a single nodule, six patients (18 %) had between 2 and 5 nodules, 2 (6 %) between 6 and 10 nodules and 13 (39 %) had more than 10 nodules. The mean size of the nodules was 21 mm, with a maximum size ranging between 5-50 mm. No nodules had cavitation radiographically. The upper lobes were most commonly involved. Histology was available for 18 patients and showed evidence of granulation tissue, fibrosis, and visualisation of fungal hyphae. Conclusion: Pulmonary nodules are a less common manifestation of aspergillosis in immunocompetent patients. Distinguishing these nodules from other lung pathology may be difficult on CT findings alone.

Title:  Digital control  
Abstract: This work outlines an equation-based formulation of a digital control program and transducer interacting with a continuous physical process, and an approach using the Coq theorem prover for verifying the performance of the combined hybrid system. Considering thermal dynamics with linear dissipation for simplicity, we focus on a generalizable, physically consistent description of the interaction of the real-valued temperature and the digital program acting as a thermostat. Of interest in this work is the discovery and formal proof of bounds on the temperature, the degree of variation, and other performance characteristics. Our approach explicitly addresses the need to mathematically represent the decision problem inherent in an analog-to-digital converter, which for rare values can take an arbitrarily long time to produce a digital answer (the so-called Buridan's Principle); this constraint ineluctably manifests itself in the verification of thermostat performance. Furthermore, the temporal causality constraints in the thermal physics must be made explicit to obtain a consistent model for analysis. We discuss the significance of these findings toward the verification of digital control for more complex physical variables and fields.

Title: Life themes
Abstract: LIFE THEMES is a drama anthology that provides complete scripts for the 12 plays discussed in PLAYS FOR THE THEATRE's Dramatic Interlude sections. The anthology mirrors the Interludes with six themes: love, war, generations, rebellion, dreams, and values. Each theme is represented by both a classical and a contemporary play. While the first play is usually by a white male from a previous century, the second modern script is from women, Asian-American, Latino, and African-American writers. For each play, the editors provide historical context, a biography about the playwright, an examination of contemporary relevance of the script, a discussion of other works by the playwright, and suggestions for further study. From the authors, Robert Barton and Annie McGregor: We hope these 12 plays will not only introduce readers to the breadth, depth, and scope of theatre, but will also engage their minds, emotions, and empathy for a huge spectrum of humanity outside their own experience.

Title:  Polymerase chain reaction  
Abstract: The multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) encodes for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which plays a pathophysiological role in the development of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Herein, we aimed to investigate the relationship between MDR1 gene polymorphisms and SLE susceptibility in the Chinese Guangxi population. The genotypes of rs1128503 and rs1045642 in MDR1 gene were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 283 SLE patients and 247 healthy controls from Guangxi. Direct sequencing method was used to verify the results. Binary logistic regression analyses adjusting for gender and age indicated that subjects carrying the rs1128503 T-allele and TT genotype were at increased risk of SLE when compared to carriers of the C allele and CC genotype, with adjusted ORs of 1.36 (95% CI 1.07-1.74; P = 0.014) and 1.77 (95% CI 1.08-2.88; P = 0.022), respectively. In addition, the risk allele T had a recessive effect (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.04-2.14, P = 0.029). Subgroup analyses revealed effect modification by age for the presence of the rs1128503 T allele, yielding a significant positive association with SLE in older (ae40 years) subjects (T vs. C allele: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.96; P = 0.041; TT vs. CC genotype: OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.07-2.79; P = 0.021). For the first time, we demonstrated that MDR1 rs1128503 polymorphisms were associated with SLE susceptibility in Chinese Guangxi population.

Title: Leadership and role modelling
Abstract: This edited volume explores the influence of role modelling as a process in the workplace; in particular, whether it can aid career development, offer psycho-social support, and provide the motivation and means to achieve goals. Chapters examine whether the dynamics of personal identification and self-belief can affect the way that role models are chosen, placing emphasis on geographical diversity and cultural aspects. By including studies of gender and followership in both American and Indian settings, the scholars and practitioners who contribute to this collection outline key aspects of role modelling, and its effect as a developmental tool in the workplace, from the perspective of the individual and organisations. This book is a valuable resource for academics interested in organisations, management, and diversity, as well as practitioners and policy-makers involved in leadership programmes, who will find its collection of both theoretical and empirical findings extremely useful.

Title:  Computer vision  
Abstract: Compared with vertical photogrammtry, oblique photogrammetry is radically different for images acquired from sensor with big yaw, pitch, and roll angles. Image matching is a vital step and core problem of oblique low-altitude photogrammetric process. Among the most popular oblique images matching methods are currently SIFT/ASIFT and many affine invariant feature-based approaches, which are mainly used in computer vision, while these methods are unsuitable for requiring evenly distributed corresponding points and high efficiency simultaneously in oblique photogrammetry. In this paper, we present an oblique low-altitude images matching approach using robust perspective invariant features. Firstly, the homography matrix is estimated by a few corresponding points obtained from top pyramid images matching in several projective simulation. Then images matching are implemented by sub-pixel Harris corners and descriptors after shape perspective transforming on the basis of homography matrix. Finally, the error or gross error matched points are excluded by epipolar geometry, RANSAC algorithm and back projection constraint. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve more excellent performances in oblique low-altitude images matching than the common methods, including SIFT and SURF. And the proposed approach can significantly improve the computational efficiency compared with ASIFT and Affine-SURF.

Title: Artificial intelligence and the law in Canada 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform the economy, the nature of work, entire fields of human endeavor such as medicine and engineering, and the nature of government and commercial decision-making. Many of these transformations are already underway, with the technology advancing more quickly than we seem equipped to regulate it. Yet although there has been relatively little AI-specific litigation or legislation in Canada--or elsewhere for that matter--the rapid advance of these technologies creates a need to interrogate how our existing legal frameworks can apply or how they may need to adapt to this fundamentally disruptive technology. This book reflects upon the risks and the potential for AI technologies, providing valuable insight into the state of AI and the law in Canada. The book is divided into discrete topics discussing how AI interfaces or impacts traditional subject areas of law such as: copyright law; patent and trade secrets; contract law; tort law; data protection law; competition law; administrative law; and health law.--

Title:  Smart Material  
Abstract: Fe3O4-Au hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs) have shown increasing potential for biomedical applications such as image guided stimuli responsive drug delivery. Incorporation of the unique properties of HNPs into thermally responsive scaffolds holds great potential for future biomedical applications. Here we successfully fabricated smart scaffolds based on thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNiPAM). Nanoparticles providing localized trigger of heating when irradiated with a short laser burst were found to give rise to remote control of bulk polymer shrinkage. Gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using wet chemical precipitation methods followed by electrochemical coating. After subsequent functionalization of particles with allyl methyl sulfide, mercaptodecane, cysteamine and poly(ethylene glycol) thiol to enhance stability, detailed biological safety was determined using live/dead staining and cell membrane integrity studies through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) quantification. The PEG coated HNPs did not show significant cytotoxic effect or adverse cellular response on exposure to 7F2 cells (p < 0.05) and were carried forward for scaffold incorporation. The pNiPAM-HNP composite scaffolds were investigated for their potential as thermally triggered systems using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These studies show that incorporation of HNPs resulted in scaffold deformation after very short irradiation times (seconds) due to internal structural heating. Our data highlights the potential of these hybrid-scaffold constructs for exploitation in drug delivery, using methylene blue as a model drug being released during remote structural change of the scaffold.

Title:  Ankylosing Spondylitis  
Abstract: Introduction: Early diagnosis, monitoring of disease activity, prediction of treatment response, and structural outcome remain major challenges in spondyloarthritis (SpA). Biomarkers could play a role in addressing these challenges, but in SpA there is a lack of suitable biomarkers.Areas covered: As SpA is clinically and pathophysiologically closely related to psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we reviewed in literature, the value of serum biomarkers in these conditions with the aim to find potential candidates for assessing SpA.Expert commentary: Candidates of interest were antimicrobial peptides, including serum human beta defensin-2 (hBD-2) and lipocalin-2 (LCN-2), and class-1 MHC molecule beta2-microglobulin. Since these biomarkers are relevant in psoriasis and/or IBD from a pathophysiological point of view, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of SpA, we recommend further exploration of their value as biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of SpA.

Title:  Parkinson's Disease  
Abstract: Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. The main neuropathological hallmarks of the disease are the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the accumulation of protein inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Recently, great attention has been given to the study of genes associated with both familial and sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease. Among them, the alpha-synuclein gene is believed to play a central role in the disease and is, therefore, one of the most studied genes. Parkinson's disease is a complex disorder and, as such, derives from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Here, we offer an update on the landscape of epigenetic-mediated regulation of gene expression that has been linked with alpha-synuclein and associated with Parkinson's disease. We also provide an overview of how epigenetic modifications can influence the transcription and/or translation of the alpha-synuclein gene and, on the other hand, how a-synuclein function/dysfunction can, per se, affect the epigenetic landscape. Finally, we discuss how a deeper understanding of the epigenetic profile of alpha-synuclein may enable the development of novel therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies.

Title:  Northern blotting  
Abstract: In whole cell patch-clamp recordings, we characterized the L-type Ca2+ currents in bovine adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells and explored their role, along with the role of T-type channels, in ACTH- and angiotensin II (ANG II)-stimulated cortisol secretion. Two distinct dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type currents were identified, both of which were activated at relatively hyperpolarized potentials. One activated with rapid kinetics and, in conjunction with Northern blotting and PCR, was determined to be Ca(v)1.3. The other, expressed in approximately one-half of AZF cells, activated with extremely slow voltage-dependent kinetics and combined properties not previously reported for an L-type Ca2+ channel. The T-type Ca2+ channel antagonist 3,5-dichloro-N-[1-(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2) inhibited Ca(v)3.2 current in these cells, as well as ACTH- and ANG II-stimulated cortisol secretion, at concentrations that did not affect L-type currents. In contrast, nifedipine specifically inhibited L-type currents and cortisol secretion, but less effectively than TTA-P2. Diphenylbutylpiperidine Ca2+ antagonists, including pimozide, penfluridol, and fluspirilene, and the dihydropyridine niguldipine blocked Ca(v)3.2 and L-type currents and inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion with similar potency. This study shows that bovine AZF cells express three Ca2+ channels, the voltage-dependent gating and kinetics of which could orchestrate complex mechanisms linking peptide hormone receptors to cortisol secretion through action potentials or sustained depolarization. The function of the novel, slowly activating L-type channel is of particular interest in this respect. Regardless, the well-correlated selective inhibition of T- and L-type currents and ACTH- and ANG II-stimulated cortisol secretion by TTA-P2 and nifedipine establish the critical importance of these channels in AZF cell physiology.

Title:  Depression  
Abstract: The aim of this study was to explore the significant predictors associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) outcome for patients with major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder inpatients (N=130) requiring ECT were recruited from a major psychiatric center in South Taiwan. ECT was generally performed for a maximum of 12 sessions. Symptom severity was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) before ECT, after every three ECT sessions, and after the last ECT. The generalized estimating equations method was used to analyze the influence of potential variables over time on the HAMD-17 and CGI-S, respectively. Fourteen patients not completing the first three sessions of ECT were excluded. The remaining 116 patients were included in the analysis. Patients with treatment-resistant depression, longer duration of the current depressive episode, and higher levels of pain were more likely to have less symptom reduction after acute treatment with ECT, irrespective of how the depressive symptoms were rated using HAMD-17 or CGI-S. To improve efficacy, earlier application of ECT and pain control should be considered during an acute course of ECT. Other clinical predictors related to ECT outcome require further investigation in future studies.

Title: The psychology of sub-culture in sport and physical activity
Abstract: International Perspectives on Key Issues in Sport and Exercise Psychology is a series of edited books, with a global focus, which reflect the state of art in areas of current and emerging interest in the study of sport and exercise psychology. Each volume in the series contributes to the better understanding of a key issue facing researchers and practitioners in sport psychology. This volume in the series focuses upon the sociocultural issues that challenge and often undermine participation, performance, and well-being in sports. The chapters address a number of important issues, such as exclusion, miscommunication, and ineffective practice in sport. The book extends the recent interest in culture within sport psychology by using a critical approach to highlight less mainstream sports such as martial arts, circus arts, extreme sports, and dance, and it will help sports participants and social scientists to gain an understanding of these marginalized sporting identities. By highlighting subcultural contexts, with their individual practices and values, it is hoped that the volume will promote the goal of achieving a more just, inclusive, and ethical sport psychology. The Psychology of Sub-Culture in Sport and Physical Activity will be ideal reading for sport and exercise academics and practitioners, advanced students of applied sport psychology, and related fields such as sport science, critical studies, sociology, cultural studies and social anthropology--

Title: A concise history of Poland 
Abstract: Poland is a tenacious survivor-state: it was wiped off the map in 1795, resurrected after the First World War, apparently annihilated again in the Second, and reduced to satellite status of the Soviet Union after 1945. Yet it emerged in the vanguard of resistance to the USSR in the 1980s, albeit as a much more homogeneous entity than it had been in its multi-ethnic past. This book outlines Poland's turbulent and complex history, from its medieval Christian origins to the reassertion of that Christian and European heritage after forty-five years of communism. It describes Poland's transformation since 1989, and explains how Poland navigated its way into a new Commonwealth of Nations in the European Union. Recent years have witnessed significant changes within Poland, Eastern Europe and the wider world. This new edition reflects on these changes, and examines the current issues facing a Poland which some would accuse of being out of touch with 'European values--Back cover.

Title:  Schizophrenia  
Abstract: Current antipsychotic medications fail to satisfactorily reduce negative and cognitive symptoms and produce many unwanted side effects, necessitating the development of new compounds. Cross-species, experimental behavioural model systems can be valuable to inform the development of such drugs. The aim of the current study was to further test the hypothesis that controlled sleep deprivation is a safe and effective model system for psychosis when combined with oculomotor biomarkers of schizophrenia. Using a randomized counterbalanced within-subjects design, we investigated the effects of 1 night of total sleep deprivation in 32 healthy participants on smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades (PS), antisaccades (AS), and self-ratings of psychosis-like states. Compared with a normal sleep control night, sleep deprivation was associated with reduced SPEM velocity gain, higher saccadic frequency at 0.2 Hz, elevated PS spatial error, and an increase in AS direction errors. Sleep deprivation also increased intra-individual variability of SPEM, PS, and AS measures. In addition, sleep deprivation induced psychosis-like experiences mimicking hallucinations, cognitive disorganization, and negative symptoms, which in turn had moderate associations with AS direction errors. Taken together, sleep deprivation resulted in psychosis-like impairments in SPEM and AS performance. However, diverging somewhat from the schizophrenia literature, sleep deprivation additionally disrupted PS control. Sleep deprivation thus represents a promising but possibly unspecific experimental model that may be helpful to further improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the pathophysiology of psychosis and aid the development of antipsychotic and pro-cognitive drugs.

Title: Digital renaissance
Abstract: The digital revolution poses a mortal threat to the major creative industries--music, publishing, television, and the movies. The ease with which digital files can be copied and distributed has unleashed a wave of piracy with disastrous effects on revenue. Cheap, easy self-publishing is eroding the position of these gatekeepers and guardians of culture. Does this revolution herald the collapse of culture, as some commentators claim? Far from it. In [this book], Joel Waldfogel argues that digital technology is enabling a new golden age of popular culture, a veritable digital renaissance. By reducing the costs of production, distribution, and promotion, digital technology is democratizing access to the cultural marketplace. More books, songs, television shows, and movies are being produced than ever before. Nor does this mean a tidal wave of derivative, poorly produced kitsch; analyzing decades of production and sales data, as well as bestseller and best-of lists, Waldfogel finds that the new digital model is just as successful at producing high-quality, successful work as the old industry model, and in many cases more so. The vaunted gatekeeper role of the creative industries proves to have been largely mythical. The high costs of production have stifled creativity in industries that require ever-bigger blockbusters to cover the losses on ever-more-expensive failures. Are we drowning in a tide of cultural silt, or living in a golden age for culture? The answers in Digital Renaissance may surprise you.--Dust jacket.

Title:  Menopause  
Abstract: Estradiol supplementation has been shown to enhance cognitive performance in old ovariectomized rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). To determine if similar benefits could be achieved in perimenopausal animals using alternative hormonal supplements, we administered dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to old ovary-intact female rhesus macaques for similar to 2.5months. Using computerized touch screen memory tasks, including delayed response (DR) and delayed matching-to-sample (DMS), we observed improved performance with time in all of the animals but failed to detect a significant effect of DHEA. On the other hand, gene expression profiling disclosed a significant correlation between cognitive performance and the expression of several steroidogenic and steroid-responsive genes. The DR performance was positively correlated with hippocampal expression of AKR1C3 and STAR and negatively correlated with the expression of SDRD5A1. A positive correlation was also found between DMS performance and prefrontal cortical expression of AKR1C3 and a negative correlation with STAR, as well as a negative correlation with the hippocampal expression of HSD11B1 and NR3C1. Taken together, the results suggest that steroidogenic gene regulation within the brain may help to maintain cognitive function during the perimenopausal transition period, despite a decline in sex-steroid levels in the circulation.

Title: Remarks on the phonological evolution of Russian in comparison with the other Slavic languages 
Abstract: This is the first English translation of a groundbreaking 1929 work in historical phonology by the renowned linguist Roman Jakobson, considered the founder of modern structural linguistics. A revolutionary treatment of Russian and Slavic linguistics, the book introduced a new type of historical linguistics that focused on the systematic reasons behind phonological change. Rather than treating such changes as haphazard, Jakobson here presents a teleological, purposeful approach to language evolution. He concludes by placing his book in the context of the exciting structural developments of the era, including Einstein's theories, Cezanne's art, and Lev Berg's nomogenesis.

Title:  Birth Control  
Abstract: This article retraces the history of fertility theories as illustrated by 23 founding texts grouped together in a single volume (Leridon, 2014, Les theories de la fecondite, INED). Until recent times, no reliable statistics were available for the analysis of fertility behaviours, which were treated rather as a question of philosophy, morals, political science or religion. It was not until the birth of the social sciences in the nineteenth century that the first real theories of fertility started to emerge. At that time, the demographic transition in Europe and the accompanying social and economic transformations gave rise to new demographic behaviours for which a theoretical framework was needed. Many new disciplines were brought into play, including anthropology, sociology, economics, political science and psychology. Paradoxically, demographers were slow to develop theoretical approaches, doubtless because the discipline first made its name as a quantitative science. Indeed, no overarching, generally acknowledged theory of fertility has yet been developed. These different approaches are illustrated through a series of pioneering texts. They present theories drawn from a wide range of disciplines and include analyses from the perspectives of birth control and gender.

  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:
{
  ""predictions"": [
    {""category"": ""<exact allowed name>"", ""confidence"": <float 0.00 to 1.00>},
    ...
  ]
}
5) confidence MUST be a float in [0, 1] with up to 2 decimal places.

Now classify the following text STRICTLY using the rules above:

Title: Edwards, Cheney Set to Meet in Only Debate
Abstract: CLEVELAND - Vice President Dick Cheney faces a ""master litigator"" when he debates Sen. John Edwards, a backhanded compliment offered Tuesday by the White House as it defended against criticism that the Republicans have not acknowledged errors in waging war in Iraq...
