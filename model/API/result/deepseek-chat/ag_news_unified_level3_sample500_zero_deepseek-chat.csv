Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Astronomy and allied sciences:
  The scientific study of celestial objects, phenomena, and the universe as a whole, employing observational techniques and physical principles to investigate the origins, evolution, composition, motion, and interactions of planets, stars, galaxies, and cosmic structures, while developing methods for celestial navigation, timekeeping, and understanding Earth's place in the cosmos.

- Celestial mechanics:
  The branch of astronomy that applies the principles of classical mechanics, particularly Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation, to mathematically describe and predict the motions of celestial bodies such as planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and artificial satellites, including orbital dynamics, perturbations, and gravitational interactions within multi-body systems.

- Techniques, procedures, apparatus, equipment, materials:
  The practical methodologies, observational procedures, and technological instruments used in astronomical research, including telescopes (optical, radio, space-based), detectors, spectrographs, imaging systems, data acquisition techniques, calibration methods, and specialized materials for constructing observatories and scientific equipment to collect and analyze electromagnetic radiation and other signals from celestial sources.

- Specific celestial bodies and phenomena:
  The detailed study of individual astronomical objects and events, including stars (their classification, life cycles, and properties), planets (terrestrial and gas giants), moons, asteroids, comets, nebulae, galaxies, black holes, pulsars, quasars, supernovae, variable stars, exoplanets, and transient phenomena observed throughout the universe.

- Earth (Astronomical geography):
  The astronomical study of Earth as a celestial body, examining its physical characteristics, position, and motions within the solar system and universe, including its shape, rotation, revolution, axial tilt, seasons, magnetic field, and interactions with other celestial bodies such as the Moon and Sun, from a cosmic perspective rather than a terrestrial geographical one.

- Mathematical geography:
  The application of mathematical principles and techniques to describe and analyze Earth's physical properties and spatial relationships, including coordinate systems, map projections, geodesy, measurement of Earth's dimensions, calculation of distances and areas, and mathematical modeling of geographical phenomena for astronomical and navigational purposes.

- Celestial navigation:
  The practice of determining position and direction on Earth by observing celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, using specialized instruments like sextants, almanacs, and chronometers to calculate latitude, longitude, and course, based on angular measurements and astronomical reference points.

- Ephemerides:
  Tabulated collections of predicted positions and motions of celestial bodies at regular intervals, providing essential data for astronomical observations, celestial navigation, and space mission planning, typically including coordinates, rising and setting times, phases, eclipses, and orbital elements for the Sun, Moon, planets, and selected stars.

- Chronology:
  The scientific study of time measurement and timekeeping systems, particularly as applied to astronomical phenomena, including the development and calibration of calendars, determination of historical dates through astronomical events, analysis of Earth's rotation variations, and establishment of precise time standards based on celestial motions and atomic clocks.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.
