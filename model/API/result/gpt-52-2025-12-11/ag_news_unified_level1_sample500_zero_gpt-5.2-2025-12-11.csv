- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:
{
  ""predictions"": [
    {""category"": ""<exact allowed name>"", ""confidence"": <float 0.00 to 1.00>},

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:

  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:
{
  ""predictions"": [
    {""category"": ""<exact allowed name>"", ""confidence"": <float 0.00 to 1.00>},
    ...
  ]
}
5) confidence MUST be a float in [0, 1] with up to 2 decimal places.

Now classify the following text STRICTLY using the rules above:

Title: Unctad optimistic on global FDI inflows
Abstract: The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) on Wednesday said that though global inflows of FDI fell in 2003 for the third year in a row to  $560 billion, prospects for the current year are promising.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Computer science, information, and general works:
  The interdisciplinary field encompassing the theoretical foundations of information and computation, including the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational complexity, along with the systematic organization and representation of knowledge through formal systems and the design of computational architectures that process and transform information.

- Philosophy and psychology:
  The systematic rational inquiry into fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language, employing critical analysis, logical argumentation, and conceptual clarification to examine the nature of reality, human experience, and ethical principles.

- Religion:
  The organized system of beliefs, practices, rituals, and moral codes centered on the relationship between humanity and the sacred or supernatural, encompassing theological doctrines, worship traditions, religious experiences, ethical frameworks, and institutional structures across various faith traditions.

- Social sciences:
  The interdisciplinary field of academic study that systematically investigates human societies, cultures, and social relationships through empirical observation and analysis, encompassing disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and psychology to understand social structures, institutions, and human behavior within societal contexts.

- Language:
  The comprehensive study of human communication systems encompassing their philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications across societies and historical periods, including the development of international languages, reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias, specialized linguistic topics, serial publications, organizational structures, educational methodologies, demographic considerations, and geographical or biographical treatments of language phenomena.

- Science:
  The comprehensive systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the natural world, employing empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand physical and biological phenomena from fundamental particles to complex ecosystems, encompassing both the empirical natural sciences and the formal mathematical sciences that provide their theoretical foundations.

- Technology:
  General works on technology and applied sciences that treat the subject broadly without focusing on specific engineering disciplines (like Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical engineering) or specific chemical technologies. Use this tag for comprehensive technological histories, general industrial research, or applied sciences not covered by 610-690.

- Arts and recreation:
  The comprehensive domain encompassing the creation, appreciation, and study of fine and decorative arts, including their philosophical foundations, historical development, and institutional frameworks such as museums, galleries, and educational programs.

- Literature:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing both creative literary expression and the systematic study of persuasive communication, integrating the analysis of imaginative written works with the examination of rhetorical techniques, critical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that shape literary traditions and discourse practices across diverse cultural contexts.

- History and geography:
  The comprehensive interdisciplinary field encompassing the systematic study of past human events, societies, and civilizations through documented evidence, along with the examination of Earth's physical features, human-environment interactions, and the supporting methodological tools and approaches that facilitate historical and geographical research and understanding.

- Labels (Hierarchical):
  A system of classification where categories are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, enabling the arrangement of knowledge into progressively more specific levels through nested categories that inherit properties from their broader parent classes.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:
{
  ""predictions"": [
    {""category"": ""<exact allowed name>"", ""confidence"": <float 0.00 to 1.00>},
    ...
  ]
}
5) confidence MUST be a float in [0, 1] with up to 2 decimal places.
