Title: Case approach to counseling and psychotherapy 
Abstract: CASE APPROACH TO COUNSELING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY, Eighth Edition, vividly illustrates how major counseling approaches work with a single client, Ruth. Dr. Corey provides solid examples of psychoanalytic, Adlerian, existential, person-centered, Gestalt, reality, behavior, cognitive-behavior, family systems, feminist, and postmodern theories in action. Dr. Corey applies each therapeutic approach to a single client, illustrating how the various theories work and helping you see exactly how the techniques differ. Well-respected and widely recognized practitioners serve as guest commentators, offering their unique perspectives on Ruth's case. Commentators include founders of some of the therapies, such as William Glasser for choice theory and reality therapy, Arnold Lazarus for multimodal therapy, and Albert Ellis for rational emotive behavior therapy.

Title:  Seasonal affective disorder  
Abstract: Using a large dataset obtained from ""Paipaidai,"" an online peer-to-peer lending platform in China, we examine whether credit officers' mood affects the efficiency of credit approval from a perspective of individual decision-making. Refering to studies in psychology and financial economics, we employ season, temperature and weather as mood proxies, and control the variables related to the quality of the loan to study credit approval behavior under different mood conditions. The results suggest that the efficiency of credit approval by individual credit officers is significantly correlated with their mood-a positive mood improves efficiency, while a negative mood reduces it. Specifically, loans examined under better mood conditions (e.g., during spring, comfortable temperatures, and sunny days) have a significantly higher probability of approval, but a lower probability of default if approved; and those examined under poorer mood conditions show a lower probability of approval and a higher probability of default if approved. This effect of mood is even stronger when a loan application is more complex, atypical, or unusual to evaluate. Moreover, investor sentiment, denoted by closed-end fund premiums, has the same effect on credit approval as well.

Title: Another world
Abstract: The remarkable story of the stylistic, cultural, and technical innovations that drove the surge of comics, caricature, and other print media in 19th-century Europe. Taking its title from the 1844 visionary graphic novel by J. J. Grandville, this groundbreaking book explores the invention of print media-including comics, caricature, the illustrated press, illustrated books, and popular prints-tracing their development as well as the aesthetic, political, technological, and cultural issues that shaped them. The explosion of imagery from the late 18th century to the beginning of the 20th exceeded the print production from all previous centuries combined, spurred the growth of the international art market, and encouraged the cross-fertilization of media, subjects, and styles. Patricia Mainardi examines scores of imaginative and innovative prints, focusing on highly experimental moments of discovery, when artists and publishers tested the limits of each new medium, creating visual languages that extend to the comics and graphic novels of today. Another World unearths a wealth of visual material, revealing a history of how our image-saturated world came into being, and situating the study of print culture firmly within the context of art history.

Title: Journalism, online comments, and the future of public discourse 
Abstract: Comments on digital news stories and on social media play an increasingly important role in public discourse as more citizens communicate through online networks. The reasons for eliminating comments on news stories are plentiful. Off-topic posts and toxic commentary have been shown to undermine legitimate news reporting, yet the proliferation of digital communication technology has revolutionized the setting for democratic participation. The digital exchange of ideas and opinions is now a vital component of the democratic landscape. Marie K. Shanahan's book argues that public digital discourse is crucial component of modern democracy - one that journalists must stop treating with indifference or detachment; for news organizations to recognize commenters as democratic actors and use journalistic rigor and better online design to add value to citizens' comments above the social layer. Through original interviews, anecdotes, field observations, summaries of research literature, Shanahan explains the obstacles of digital discourse as well as its promises for journalists in the digital age--

Title:  Low Testosterone  
Abstract: We report two newborns with female external genitalia and bilateral inguinal swelling who were diagnosed with 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency, a rare cause of 46,XY disorder of sexual development. The first case had normal clitoral size and vaginal and urethral openings, palpable gonads in the inguinal region, low testosterone, and low levels of basal and GNRH-stimulated gonadotropin. The second case had similar external genitalia, low testosterone but borderline basal and normal stimulated gonadotropin levels. Low testosterone/androstenedione ratios (0.22 and 0.24, respectively; normal, >0.8) after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation indicated 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency. HSD17B3 sequencing revealed a homozygous novel mutation (c.464A>C, p.H155P) in exon 6 in the first case and homozygous c.239G>A (p.R80Q) in exon 3 in the second.

Title: Planning for strategic communication
Abstract: Planning for Strategic Communication is a teaching aid and student workbook designed to supplement instruction for students learning to write plans for strategic communication scenarios. It was created to serve as a workbook for practical application accompanying Ihlen, van Ruler, & Fredriksson's Public Relations & Social Theory (Routledge, 2009). The workbook offers instruction in conducting analysis of strategic communication and offering suggestions for improved practice. This workbook is the result of years of teaching and consulting experience, and time spent mentoring students in the writing of communication plans that have impact. “In the world of strategic communication, clients are becoming leery of the increasing number of entrepreneurs masquerading as consultants. Many search for consultants who can bring true knowledge and innovation to their work. Therefore, as consultants, our job is to become not only artists of beautiful plans, but scientists that root our plans in theory and endeavor to test the results.”

Title:  Hydraulics  
Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) is important to thermal-hydraulics design and safety analysis. In the purpose to validate the CHF data acquired from LS-THTF of NPIC, experimental investigation on repeatability of the CHF data is carried out with full length non-uniform axial heat flux distribution rod bundle. The repeatability of the CHF data from LS-THTF itself is examined by comparing the data from the same run but different time and data from different runs. The rod bundle powers of CHF data acquired under well controlled parameters are directly compared with reference measured data from HTRF of Columbia University. The rod bundle power ratio of CHF data is employed to describe the repeatability of CHF data from LS-THTF to HTRF, and the variations of power ratio with inlet and outlet parameters show a reasonable trend. The point to point differences of CHF power between the two facilities of every single point are found to be within 5%. The result demonstrates good repeatability between data from LS-THTF and data from HTRF. LS-THTF is capable of acquiring reliable and repeatable CHF data to verifying thermal-hydraulics performance of PWR fuel assemblies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Hilma af Klint
Abstract: In this thorough critical appraisal, 16 specialists on modern art, art history, philosophy and religious studies examine the unique art, the cultural circumstances and art-historical positioning of Swedish abstractionist Hilma af Klint. Topics explored here range from early abstract art and the impact of Darwinism to Goethe's color theory, as well as the importance of occult religious movements such as theosophy and anthroposophy that influenced the early modernists, and discussions of af Klint's own personal diary notes and research. The book is based on the seminars that were held in conjunction with the exhibition Hilma af Klint: A Pioneer of Abstraction in 2013. This extremely successful exhibition attracted a record number of visitors to the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, after which it continued to the Hamburger Bahnhof Museum in Berlin and the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark

Title:  Manufacturing engineering  
Abstract: Although the system reliability theory has a high capability in quality quantification, while system reliability optimization (SRO) has been well developed in manufacturing engineering, seldom can their applications be found in the construction industry. This study aims to develop a system reliability theory based multiple-objective optimization model to conduct SRO, and then identify the cost-quality trade-off solution for construction projects. First the whole construction project is treated as a system composed of different work packages. Second, the reliability function is employed to quantify the quality performance and the nonlinear cost-reliability function is set up. Moreover, according to the physical arrangements among each work package, the system reliability structural function is determined. Third, the total construction cost minimization and system reliability maximization are defined as multiple-objectives. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to search for the Pareto-optimal solutions, from which the final cost-quality trade-off solution can be selected. A real construction case is used to evaluate the workability of the proposed model and the results have fully proven its validity and practicality. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  State space representation  
Abstract: Resonant converters used as coil drivers in inductive links generally operate efficiently at optimum switching conditions for constant load values and ranges. Changes in load and range can shift the operation of the coil driver to a nonoptimum switching state which results in higher switching losses and reduced output power levels. This paper presents a method to adapt to variations in range for a Class E inverter used as a coil driver in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system based on inductive coupling. It is shown that by controlling the duty cycle of the inverter's switch and the value of its dc-feed inductance, the Class E inverter can be tuned to operate at optimum switching conditions as the distance between the coils of the WPT system changes. Mathematical analysis is presented based on a linear piecewise state-space representation of the inverter and the inductive link. Extensive experimental results are presented to verify the performed analysis and validity of the proposed tuning procedure.

Now she brings her vast experience, good cheer, and finely sharpened pencils to help the rest of us in a boisterous language book as full of life as it is of practical advice.Between You & Me features Norris's laugh-out-loud descriptions of some of the most common and vexing problems in spelling, punctuation, and usage―comma faults, danglers, who vs. whom, that vs. which, compound words, gender-neutral language―and her clear explanations of how to handle them. Down-to-earth and always open-minded, she draws on examples from Charles Dickens, Emily Dickinson, Henry James, and the Lord's Prayer, as well as from The Honeymooners, The Simpsons, David Foster Wallace, and Gillian Flynn. She takes us to see a copy of Noah Webster's groundbreaking Blue-Back Speller, on a quest to find out who put the hyphen in Moby-Dick, on a pilgrimage to the world's only pencil-sharpener museum, and inside the hallowed halls of The New Yorker and her work with such celebrated writers as Pauline Kael, Philip Roth, and George Saunders.Readers―and writers―will find in Norris neither a scold nor a softie but a wise and witty new friend in love with language and alive to the glories of its use in America, even in the age of autocorrect and spell-check. As Norris writes, The dictionary is a wonderful thing, but you can't let it push you around.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Parallel computing  
Abstract: We survey genetic improvement (GI) of general purpose computing on graphics cards. We summarise several experiments which demonstrate four themes. Experiments with the gzip program show that genetic programming can automatically port sequential C code to parallel code. Experiments with the StereoCamera program show that GI can upgrade legacy parallel code for new hardware and software. Experiments with NiftyReg and BarraCUDA show that GI can make substantial improvements to current parallel CUDA applications. Finally, experiments with the pknotsRG program show that with semi-automated approaches, enormous speed ups can sometimes be had by growing and grafting new code with genetic programming in combination with human input.

Title: Socialist heritage
Abstract: Focusing on Romania from 1945 to 2016, Socialist Heritage explores the socialist state's attempt to create its own heritage, as well as the legacy of that project. Contrary to arguments that the socialist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe aimed to erase the pre-war history of the socialist cities, Emanuela Grama shows that the communist state in Romania sought to exploit the past for its own benefit. The book traces the transformation of a central district of Bucharest, the Old Town, from a socially and ethnically diverse place in the early 20th century, into an epitome of national history under socialism, and then, starting in the 2000s, into the historic center of a European capital. Under socialism, politicians and professionals used the district's historic buildings, especially the ruins of a medieval palace discovered in the 1950s, to emphasize the city's Romanian past and erase its ethnically diverse history. Since the collapse of socialism, the cultural and economic value of the Old Town has become highly contested. Bucharest's middle class has regarded the district as a site of tempting transgressions. Its poor residents have decried their semi-decrepit homes, while entrepreneurs and politicians have viewed it as a source of easy money. Such arguments point to recent negotiations about the meanings of class, political participation, and ethnic and economic belonging in today's Romania. Grama's rich historical and ethnographic research reveals the fundamentally dual nature of heritage: every search for an idealized past relies on strategies of differentiation that can lead to further marginalization and exclusion.

Title: Russian imperialism revisited
Abstract: This book examines the nature of Russia's relations with the former Soviet states (FSS), in particular with countries which formed the Commonwealth of Independent States, and seeks to assess whether there has been a resurgence of imperialism since the collapse of the USSR. The book sets out to determine whether Russian leaders have attempted to restore a sphere of influence over the former Soviet republics or whether Russia's policies reflect a genuine desire to establish normal state-to-state relations with the new states. It adopts a comprehensive approach, analysing Russia's policies towards the FSS across a broad range of areas: energy, trade and investment; military assistance, security provision and peacekeeping; conflict management, political support, and alliance formation. While not denying the Kremlin's assertive role in the FSS, this book challenges the assumption that Russia has always intended to restore a sphere of influence over its 'Near Abroad'. Rather, it argues that Russia's policies are much more complex, multi-faceted, and often incoherent. In essence, they generally reflect a combination of legitimate state interests, enduring Soviet legacies, and genuine concerns over events unfolding along Russia's borders. This book also shows that, at times, great-power nostalgia and a real difficulty with discarding Russia's imperial legacy shapes Russia's behaviour towards the FSS. This book will be of great interest to students of Russian politics and foreign policy, east European politics, and International Relations in general--

Title:  Senior Health  
Abstract: Background: The impact of presumed consent on donation rates has been widely debated. In June 2013 Greece adopted a 'soft' presumed consent law for organ and tissue donation, where relatives' approval is sought prior to organ removal. Aims: To report on the knowledge, attitudes and concerns of undergraduate students, enrolled in three health science disciplines, in regards to organ donation and presumed consent. Methods: Undergraduate junior and senior health science students [medical (MS), nursing (NS) and medical laboratory students (MLS)] were recruited from higher education settings in Thessaly, Greece. Dichotomous questions, previously used, were adopted to assess knowledge, attitudes and concerns towards organ donation, together with questions regarding the recent presumed consent legislation. Results: Three hundred seventy-one out of 510 students participated in the study (response rate: 72.7%). Only 3.6% of NS, 8.7% of MS and 3.2% of MLS carried a donor card. Although over 78% in all groups knew that it was possible to leave kidneys for transplant after death, only 10% to 39% considered themselves well-informed. NS were more likely to consider opting-out (21.5%), followed by MLS (17.9%) and MS (10.9%). Respondents were more likely to refuse organ removal upon death when expressing one of the following views: a) opposing a system making it lawful to take kidneys from an adult who has just died, unless forbidden while alive [Odds ratio (OR) 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.96 (1.48-5.93), p=0.002], b) worrying about their kidneys being removed after death [OR, 95% CI: 3.37 (1.75-6.49), p=<0.001] and c) believing that an intact body was needed after death [OR, 95% CI: 4.23 (2.15-8.31), p<0.001]. Conclusion: Health science students, soon to become healthcare professionals, demonstrated limited awareness in regards to the newly reformed organ donation system. Identified knowledge deficits and concerns could have far-reaching implications in terms of conveying a clear message and shaping the public's stand. The feasibility and effectiveness of a joint inter-professional curriculum on organ and tissue donation issues across all three health science disciplines, addressing common themes and concerns deserves further study.

Title: Languages and dialects in the U.S.
Abstract: Languages and Dialects in the U.S. is a concise introduction to linguistic diversity in the U.S. for students with little to no background in linguistics. The goal of the editors of this collection of fourteen chapters, written by leading experts on the language varieties discussed, is to offer students detailed insight into the languages they speak or hear around them, grounded in comprehensive coverage of the linguistic systems underpinning them. The book begins with setting the stage chapters, introducing the sociocultural context of the languages and dialects featured in the book. The remaining chapters are each devoted to particular U.S. dialects and varieties of American English, each with problem sets and suggested further readings to reinforce basic concepts and new linguistic terminology and to encourage further study of the languages and dialects covered. By presenting students with both the linguistic and social, cultural, and political foundations of these particular dialects and variations of English, Languages and Dialects in the U.S. is the ideal text for students interested in linguistic diversity in the U.S., in introductory courses in sociolinguistics, language and culture, and language variation and change--

Title:  Polymerase chain reaction  
Abstract: An approximately 3,000 finishing swine operation in the United States experienced an outbreak of an atypical neurologic disease in 11-weeks-old pigs with an overall morbidity of 20% and case fatality rate of 30%. The clinical onset and progression of signs in affected pigs varied but included inappetence, compromised ambulation, ataxia, incoordination, mental dullness, paresis, paralysis and decreased response to environmental stimuli. Tissues from affected pigs were submitted for diagnostic investigation. Histopathologic examination of the cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord revealed severe lymphoplasmacytic and necrotizing polioencephalomyelitis with multifocal areas of gliosis and neuron satellitosis, suggestive of a neurotropic viral infection. Bacterial pathogens were not isolated by culture of neurologic tissue from affected pigs. Samples tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were negative for pseudorabies virus and atypical porcine pestivirus. Immunohistochemistry for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine circovirus and Listeria was negative. Porcine sapelovirus (PSV) was identified in spinal cord by a nested PCR used to detect porcine enterovirus, porcine teschovirus and PSV. Next-generation sequencing of brainstem and spinal cord samples identified PSV and the absence of other or novel pathogens. In addition, Sapelovirus A mRNA was detected in neurons and nerve roots of the spinal cord by in situ hybridization. The PSV is genetically novel with an overall 94% amino acid identity and 86% nucleotide identity to a recently reported sapelovirus from Korea. This is the first case report in the United States associating sapelovirus with severe polioencephalomyelitis in pigs.

Title:  Water Pollution  
Abstract: Background: China's rapid urbanization over the past decades has exacerbated the problems of environmental degradation and health disparities. However, few studies have analysed the differences between urban and rural residents in relation to how environmental quality impacts health outcomes. This study examines the associations between Chinese people's perceptions of environmental quality and their self-rated health, particularly focusing on differences between rural and urban residents in environment-health relationships. Methods: Using a logistic regression model and data from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), a representative sample of data for 3,402 urban residents (46 +/- 16 years) and 2,439 rural residents (48 +/- 15 years) was analysed. The dependent variable used for the logistic regressions was whether or not respondents reported being healthy. Independent variables included respondents' evaluations of the living environment, and how frequently they participated in physical activities. Interaction terms were employed to measure the moderating effects of physical exercise on the relationship between perceived environmental quality and health. Results: The percentage of healthy urban residents was significantly larger than that of healthy rural respondents (70.87% versus 62.87%). Urban respondents living in areas with sufficient green space were more likely to report good health (OR = 0.749, CI = [0.628, 0.895]), while rural respondents without reliable access to fresh water were more likely to report poor health (OR = 0.762, CI = [0.612, 0.949]). Urban respondents who were exposed to green spaces and exercised frequently were 21.6 per cent more likely to report good health than those who exercised infrequently (OR = 1.216, CI = [1.047, 1.413]). Those who lived in areas with insufficient green space and exercised frequently were 19.1 per cent less likely to report good health than those who exercised infrequently (OR = 0.805, CI = [0.469, 1.381]). No evidence suggested that physical exercise exerted a moderating effect on the relationship between exposure to air pollution and health. Conclusions: On average, urban residents have better health than rural residents. Among four indicators for low environmental quality (air pollution, lack of green spaces, water pollution, uncertain access to freshwater resources), green space was an important determinant of urban residents' health status, while unreliable access to fresh water harmed rural residents' health. Physical exercise moderated the effects of exposure to green spaces on urban residents' health.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Working together
Abstract: Advances in the social sciences have emerged through a variety of research methods: field-based research, laboratory and field experiments, and agent-based models. However, which research method or approach is best suited to a particular inquiry is frequently debated and discussed. Working Together examines how different methods have promoted various theoretical developments related to collective action and the commons, and demonstrates the importance of cross-fertilization involving multimethod research across traditional boundaries. The authors look at why cross-fertilization is difficult to achieve, and they show ways to overcome these challenges through collaboration.The authors provide numerous examples of collaborative, multimethod research related to collective action and the commons. They examine the pros and cons of case studies, meta-analyses, large-N field research, experiments and modeling, and empirically grounded agent-based models, and they consider how these methods contribute to research on collective action for the management of natural resources. Using their findings, the authors outline a revised theory of collective action that includes three elements: individual decision making, microsituational conditions, and features of the broader social-ecological context.

Title: What's wrong with the United Nations and how to fix it 
Abstract: Seven decades after its establishment, the United Nations and its system of related organizations and programs are perpetually in crisis. While the twentieth-century s world wars gave rise to ground-breaking efforts at international organization in 1919 and 1945, today s UN is ill-equipped to deal with contemporary challenges to world order. Neither the end of the Cold War nor the aftermath of 911 has led to the next generation of multilateral institutions. But what exactly is wrong with the UN that makes it incapable of confronting contemporary global challenges and, more importantly, can we fix it? In this revised and updated third edition of his popular text, leading scholar of global governance Thomas G. Weiss takes a diagnose-and-cure approach to the world organization s inherent difficulties. In the first half of the book, he considers: the problems of international leadership and decision making in a world of self-interested states; the diplomatic complications caused by the artificial divisions between the industrialized North and the global South; the structural problems of managing the UN s many overlapping jurisdictions, agencies, and bodies; and the challenges of bureaucracy and leadership. The second half shows how to mitigate these maladies and points the way to a world in which the UN s institutional ills might be cured. Weiss s remedies are not based on pious hopes of a miracle cure for the UN, but rather on specific and encouraging examples that could be replicated. With considered optimism and in contrast to received wisdom, he contends that substantial change is both plausible and possible.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: The public dimension of foreign policy 
Abstract: How does US foreign policy get made? Why are official statements on foreign policy so often unclear? What influences shape citizens' perceptions of international events? Who supplies the money for public advocacy of global issues? What is the influence of academic in government decisions? Why has Congress become the catalyst in the national debate on US foreign policy? In The Public Dimension of Foreign Policy, former Under Secretary of State and Ambassador David Newsom offers a trenchant analysis from a long-term insider's point of view of how our foreign policy is shaped and sometimes mis-shaped. Beginning with an explanation of the constitutional basis of free expression and public pressures, the book's twelve chapters examine the elements that combine to create both perceptions of events and the impetus for action. Newsom's thesis is that in the United States the public, including the press, bolstered by the First Amendment, plays a major role in shaping our foreign policy. Although some of the policy-making process is secret, the success of the American democracy ultimately depends on public support. Creation of that support involves the White House, numerous agencies, and nearly every cabinet department in an effort to control the flow of information through the print media, radio, and television. The desire for secrecy is constantly at war in our society with the media's power to make information public, and many institutions outside the government are constantly trying to influence the process. Newsom discusses the reporting dimension, conflicting objectives within the government, the influence of money in various forms, the influence of think tanks and lobbies, and finally the role of Congress itself. The chasm dividing the scholarly from the practitioner's view of foreign policy is brilliantly dissected in the chapter on Academia. Detailed case studies look at the negotiations over the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II): Nicaragua after the fall of Somoza, apartheid in South Africa, and the civil war in Angola. This book is full of practical insights from a keen observer. It is a must for anyone who wishes to understand how the United States makes its foreign policy.

Title:  Depression  
Abstract: Chronic breathlessness is a common source of psychological and physical stress in patients with advanced or progressive disease, suggesting that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation may be prevalent. The aim of this study was to measure the salivary diurnal cortisol profile in patients receiving supportive and palliative care for a range of malignant and non-malignant conditions and to compare the profile of those experiencing moderate-to-severe disability due to breathlessness against that of patients with mild/no breathlessness and that of healthy controls. Saliva samples were collected over two consecutive weekdays at 3, 6, and 12 h after awakening in 49 patients with moderate-to-severe breathlessness [Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea grade >= 3], 11 patients with mild/no breathlessness (MRC dyspnoea grade <= 2), and 50 healthy controls. Measures of breathlessness, stress, anxiety, depression, wellbeing and sleep were examined concomitantly. The diurnal cortisol slope (DCS) was calculated for each participant by regressing log-transformed cortisol values against collection time. Mean DCS was compared across groups using ANCOVA. Individual slopes were categorised into one of four categories: consistent declining, consistent flat, consistent ascending and inconsistent. Controlling for age, gender and socioeconomic status, the mean DCS was significantly flatter in patients with moderate-to-severe breathlessness compared to patients with mild/no breathlessness and healthy controls [F (2,103) = 45.64, p<0.001]. Furthermore, there was a higher prevalence of flat and ascending cortisol profiles in patients with moderate-to-severe breathlessness (23.4%) compared to healthy controls (0%). The only variable which correlated significantly with DCS was MRC dyspnoea grade (rs=0.29, p<0.05). These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe breathlessness have evidence of HPA axis dysregulation and that this dysregulation may be related to the functional disability imposed by breathlessness.

Title: Viking identities
Abstract: Viking Identities is the first detailed archaeological study of Viking-Age Scandinavian-style female dress items from England. Based on primary archival and archaeological research, including the analysis of hundreds of recent metal-detector finds, it presents evidence for over 500 brooches and pendants worn by women in the late ninth and tenth centuries. Jane F. Kershaw argues that these finds add an entirely new dimension to the limited existing archaeological evidence for Scandinavian activity in the British Isles, and make possible a substantial reassessment of the Viking settlements. In this volume, Kershaw offers an interpretation of the significance of the jewellery in a broad, historical context. The jewellery highlights locations of settlement not commonly associated with the Vikings. In contrast to claims of high levels of cultural assimilation, the jewellery suggests that incoming groups maintained a distinct Scandinavian identity which was sometimes appropriated by the indigenous population. The author also addresses one of the great unanswered questions in the study of Viking-Age settlements: what about the women? The interpretation of the jewellery challenges traditional perceptions of Viking conquest as an all-male affair and brings into focus a population group which has, until now, been almost invisible. Kershaw describes the objects and explores a number of themes related to their contemporary use, including their date, distribution, and function in costume. This body of material - unknown 30 years ago - is introduced to a public audience for the first time. Including many object images and maps, the study provides a practical guide to the identification of Scandinavian metalwork.

Title: Writing performative Shakespeares
Abstract: This innovative study offers a genuinely groundbreaking approach to Shakespeare in performance. Six chapters work like case studies, each highly creative in terms of visual form and structure - including puzzles, comics and pinboards - inviting the reader into playful engagement with the performative dimensions of Shakespearean production. The case studies include discussion of training and rehearsal processes; the materiality of the performance event and its various embodiments; the intertextual citations through which productions make meaning; and, in response to all of this, the multiplicity and variety of audience perspectives and interpretations. Conkie's production choices range from original practices to politicised adaptations, small-scale workshops to multimedia spectacles, offering inventive analyses of what Shakespeare might mean, or can be made to mean, at particular times and in specific places, at the start of the twenty-first century--Provided by publisher.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Menopause  
Abstract: BACKGROUND Pelvic organ prolapse is a downward descent of pelvic organs and results in protrusion of the vagina and the uterus. It often provides additional symptoms to patient's life already complicated by menopause. There has been a considerable variation in presentation depending on numerous variables like age, ethnicity, education and symptoms. Aim-Present study aims at studying various factors governing symptomatology and treatment choice of women in perimenopausal age group with uterovaginal prolapse in a central Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective study in which, all women attending Gynaecology Outpatient Department of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur presenting with pelvic organ prolapse over a period of 3 years from January 2013 to December 2015 were studied. They were studied for differences in sociodemographic factors, treatment choices and followed up for a period of 6 months after surgical/conservative treatment. RESULTS A total of 256 women were studied. According to our study, the risk of prolapse increased with age, increasing parity and increasing body mass index (BMI). Duration of symptoms ranged from 2 months to 15 years with 26.4% suffering for more than 5 years. Younger women were more likely to present earlier, opting more commonly for surgical treatment. CONCLUSION There is a need for increasing awareness as well as primary prevention regarding uterovaginal prolapse in general population and especially in perimenopausal age group. This can be instrumental in early access to health care system.

Title:  Depression  
Abstract: Background: Although many web-based mental health interventions are being released, the actual uptake by end users is limited. The marginal level of engagement of end users when developing these interventions is recognized as an important cause for uptake problems. In this paper, we offer our perceptive on how to improve user engagement. By doing so, we aim to stimulate a discourse on user involvement within the field of online mental health interventions. Methods: We shortly describe three different methods (the expert-driven method, intervention mapping, and scrum) that were currently used to develop web-based health interventions. We will focus to what extent the end user was involved in the developmental phase, and what the additional challenges were. In the final paragraph, lessons learned are summarized, and recommendations provided. Results: Every method seems to have its trade-off: if end users are highly involved, availability of end users and means become problematic. If end users are less actively involved, the product may be less appropriate for the end user. Other challenges to consider are the funding of the more active role of technological companies, and the time it takes to process the results of shorter development cycles. Conclusion: Thinking about user-centered design and carefully planning, the involvement of end users should become standard in the field of web-based (mental) health. When deciding on the level of user involvement, one should balance the need for input from users with the availability of resources such as time and funding.

Title:  Heart Disease  
Abstract: BackgroundCertain individuals appear to be predisposed to recurrent pasture-associated laminitis. Previous studies have predominantly investigated risk factors only after disease occurrence. ObjectivesTo investigate risk factors for pasture-associated laminitis prior to disease occurrence. Study designProspective cohort study. MethodsNon-laminitic ponies aged 7 years were recruited. Body condition score (BCS), height, weight, crest height and thickness were measured and an overnight dexamethasone suppression test performed. Plasma or serum adiponectin, leptin, triglyceride, basal insulin, insulin post-dexamethasone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-3, C-reactive protein, von Willebrand's factor, soluble E-selectin and P-selectin concentrations were assayed. Follow-up data were obtained from owners annually for 3 years to ascertain occurrences of veterinarian-diagnosed pasture-associated laminitis. Data were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was performed for significant risk factors and cut-off values determined. ResultsA total of 446 animals with a median (interquartile range) age of 15 (10-20) years were recruited. Of these, 50.4% were mares and 49.6% were geldings. The most common breeds were Welsh (36.4%), Shetland (17.0%) and cob (9.4%). Overall, 72.2% of animals were overweight/obese (BCS 7-9/9), 27.3% were of ideal weight (BCS 4-6/9) and 0.5% were underweight (BCS 1-3/9). After 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively, 18 (4.0%), 30 (6.7%) and 44 (9.9%) animals were reported to have had laminitis. Plasma adiponectin, and serum basal (insulin) and (insulin) post-dexamethasone levels were significantly (P 0.05) associated with laminitis occurrence cumulatively after 1, 2 and 3 years. Use of the area under the ROC curves to distinguish animals that did and did not develop laminitis showed good (basal [insulin] after 1 year), fair (all others) or poor ([insulin] post-dexamethasone) levels of accuracy. Main limitationsAnimals were evaluated at a single time point and biomarkers were assayed using single assays. ConclusionsRisk factors for future laminitis prior to disease occurrence include low plasma adiponectin and high serum basal insulin or insulin post-dexamethasone concentrations.

Title:  Fungal Infection  
Abstract: Background: Dermatophytosis is the most important superficial fungal infection which affects nearly 20% of human population worldwide. Recurrence of disease and emerging resistance of Trichophyton rubrum to synthetic antifungals are the main problems in control of dermatophytosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) on T. rubrum growth, ergosterol biosynthesis and keratinase activity. Methods: A CAP system, comprised of helium 98% oxygen 2% (He/O-2), was used. Trichophyton rubrum conidia suspensions were treated with CAP in time periods of 90, 120, 150 and 180 s in 96-well microplates. Fungal growth was evaluated by counting the colony forming unit (CFU). Fungal dry weight, ergosterol biosynthesis and keratinase activity were evaluated in CAP-treated T. rubrum and untreated controls. Results: 7: rubrum growth was significantly inhibited by 62%-91%. CAP strongly suppressed fungal ergosterol biosynthesis by 27%-54%. The keratinase activity was increased by 7.30%-21.88% up to 120 s CAP exposure. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated for the first time that CAP inhibits T. rubrum growth, suppresses ergosterol biosynthesis and increases moderately keratinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, CAP exposure could be a potentially useful method for treatment of clinical cases of human and animal dermatophytoses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Depression  
Abstract: The structure of oceanic spreading centres and subsurface melt distribution within newly formed crust is largely understood from marine seismic experiments. In Iceland, however, sub-aerial rift elevation allows both accurate surface mapping and the installation of large broadband seismic arrays. We present a study using ambient noise Rayleigh wave tomography to image the volcanic spreading centres across Iceland. Our high resolution model images a continuous band of low seismic velocities, parallelling all three segments of the branched rift in Iceland. The upper 10 km contains strong velocity variations, with shear wave velocities 0.5 km s(-1) faster in the older non-volcanically active regions compared to the active rifts. Slow velocities correlate very closely with geological surface mapping, with contours of the anomalies parallelling the edges of the neo-volcanic zones. The low-velocity band extends to the full 50 km width of the neo-volcanic zones, demonstrating a significant contrast with the narrow (8 km wide) magmatic zone seen at fast spreading ridges, where the rate of melt supply is similarly high. Within the seismically slow rift band, the lowest velocity cores of the anomalies occur above the centre of the mantle plume under the Vatnajtikull icecap, and in the Eastern Volcanic Zone under the central volcano Katla. This suggests localisation of melt accumulation at these specific volcanic centres, demonstrating variability in melt supply into the shallow crust along the rift axis. Shear velocity inversions with depth show that the strongest velocity contrasts are found in the upper 8 km, and show a slight depression in the shear velocity through the mid crust (10-20 km) in the rifts. Our model also shows less intensity to the slow rift anomaly in the Western Volcanic Zone, supporting the notion that rift activity here is decreasing as the ridge jumps to the Eastern Volcanic Zone.

Title:  Diabetes  
Abstract: To determine the effect of piragliatin on the QTcS (QT-corrected study-specific) interval, a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-period, 4-treatment, 4-sequence randomized crossover trial was performed in 42 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received 100 and 200mg piragliatin twice daily, placebo, and 400mg moxifloxacin (on day 1 and day 5 only) for 5days. In the categorical analyses, piragliatin did not have a clinically significant effect on the QTcS interval at either dose, and the majority of patients were categorized with low risk for maximum change from baseline (<= 30 milliseconds) and a maximum postbaseline QTcS interval as normal (<= 450 milliseconds). However, in the analysis of variance model, both piragliatin doses crossed the 10-millisecond threshold (100 mg twice daily on day 5, hour 1; 200 mg twice daily on days 1 and 5, hours 1 and 2) with P values indicating statistical significance. Headache and mild hypoglycemia were the most frequent adverse events associated with piragliatin treatment. There appeared that the effect of piragliatin treatment on the QTc interval was dose/exposure dependent following short-term multiple doses. Longer-term monitoring of electrocardiograms with pharmacokinetic exposure should continue, especially at conditions for potentially higher pharmacokinetic exposure.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services.

Title:  Fluid mechanics  
Abstract: Laboratory experiments were conducted in a large-scale meandering compound channel to investigate the flow patterns at the apex and cross-over sections. An equation in curvilinear co-ordinates was derived from the momentum equation and the flow continuity equation. In this equation, two shear stress terms are ignored due to their negligible contributions such that simple expressions are obtained. Several groups of experimental data from the published literature were used to verify this model. Comparison of the experimental and predictive results indicates that the proposed method is capable of accurately forecasting the stage discharge in meandering compound channels. Finally, the simple analytical solution of this model and the velocity parameter are further discussed.

Title:  Parkinson's Disease  
Abstract: In the current work, we present the methodology for development of an Item Response Theory model within a non-linear mixed effects framework to characterize the longitudinal changes of the Movement Disorder Society (sponsored revision) of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) endpoint in Parkinson's disease (PD). The data were obtained from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database and included 163,070 observations up to 48 months from 430 subjects belonging to De Novo PD cohort. The probability of obtaining a score, reported for each of the items in the questionnaire, was modeled as a function of the subject's disability. Initially, a single latent variable model was explored to characterize the disease progression over time. However, based on the understanding of the questionnaire set-up and the results of a residuals-based diagnostic tool, a three latent variable model with a mixture implementation was able to adequately describe longitudinal changes not only at the total score level but also at each individual item level. The linear progression rates obtained for the patient-reported items and the non-sided items were similar, each of which roughly take about 50 months for a typical subject to progress linearly from the baseline by one standard deviation. However for the sided items, it was found that the better side deteriorates quicker than the disabled side. This study presents a framework for analyzing MDS-UPDRS data, which can be adapted to more traditional UPDRS data collected in PD clinical trials and result in more efficient designs and analyses of such studies.

Title: Professional learning in higher education and communities
Abstract: This book challenges the current thrust of neoliberalism and economic managerialism by unfolding a new vision of participatory action learning and action research (PALAR) as a philosophy, methodology, and theory of learning and the facilitation process. The focus is on professional learning conceived as being participatory, collaborative, holistic and transformative, particularly through critical reflection and an affective-socio-cognitive approach. In a unique new approach, Professional Learning in Higher Education and Communities adopts a novel integration of social science with neuroscience to explain the processes and significance of PALAR. This provides the basis for justifying PALAR as an effective way to collaboratively achieve positive change, sustainable development and social justice, based on human agency and democratic values, for the common good and thus a better world for all. This book itself is testament to the critical reflection and affective-socio-cognitive approach that it advocates--

Title: Women and creativity
Abstract: This latest book in the KarnacPsychoanalysis and Women Series from the International Psychoanalytic Associations' Committee on Women and Psychoanalysis (COWAP) includes writings from practicing psychoanalysts mainly from Italy and Europe. They take a wide sweep in exploring many aspects of women's creativity with an emphasis throughout the chapters on the contribution of dreaming to creativity. It takes as its starting point creativity in clinical work in the consulting room, and puts forward new perspectives on psychoanalytic theory. The focus then turns to creativity in the life cycle, particularly when there are delays and difficulties in becoming pregnant, as well as the everyday creativity in overcoming obstacles to intimacy and coupling and being able to allow the female body in particular to be receptive to growing and nurturing an infant human being. It turns next to aspects of female creativity in the arts in the broadest sense, discussing artworks and sculpture, film and literature. Lastly, it considers aspects of creative living in society, the large, small and unseen creativity in culture, society and the structures that we live with. This book is dedicated to the memory of Mariam Alizade, who as the second Chair of COWAP, lived with such creativity.

Title: The problem of social inequality
Abstract: Within and among nations, rising levels of social inequality threaten our collective future. Currently, upwards of 80% of people's life chances are determined by factors over which they have absolutely no control. Social inequality threatens the democratic project because it destroys the trust on which governments depend, and it gives rise to corrupt political and economic institutions. How can we get out of the traps we have created for ourselves? We need to reboot capitalism. Drawing on diverse examples from a range of countries, McNall explains the social, economic, and ecological traps we have set for ourselves and develops a set of rules of resilience that are necessary conditions for the creation and maintenance of democratic societies, and a set of rules essential for creating a sustainable future.

Title: The life in your garden
Abstract: Horticulture experts Reeser Manley and Marjorie Peronto share their own experiences in gardening for biodiversity, placing a strong emphasis on insect diversity as a bellwether of success. Insects comprise 60 percent of Earth’s biodiversity, and they deserve to be recognized as the creatures that run our gardens. It is not the gardener’s job to eliminate insects that munch on leaves, suck the sap from stems, bore holes in fruits, or graze on roots. This is the work of predatory insects and arachnids such as ladybug beetles, hoverfly larvae, praying mantises, certain wasps, and spiders. It is the gardener’s task to cultivate populations of these predators. The Life in Your Garden also describes the functional plants of a garden (with recommendations for understory trees and shrubs throughout North America) and their relationship with garden life, introducing the concept of a “garden insectary.”

Title: Explaining railway reform in China
Abstract: Having been state-owned for decades, the railway reform in China confused many people, particularly in terms of its ownership and property rights arrangements. Western literature always prescribes that the best model for railway reform is privatization. China's leadership has also enunciated the state's determination to re-arrange property rights and rejuvenate corporate governance. But is China's railway reform really a story of convergence and will the Chinese government follow the western model of railway reform? Addressing these questions, this book provides a positive explanation of the reform in China's railway sector between 1978 and the dissolution of the Ministry of Railways. It bridges the socialist reform and transport policy literature, and studies the empirical changes of the property rights arrangements in China's railway system. Refuting the convergence theory, it concludes that the cyclical reform policies of decentralization and re-centralization were actually an exploratory and interactive mechanism of assets discovery and assets recovery. This in-depth study is based on 21 face-to-face interviews with railway cadres as well as field trips to collect first-hand information in Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Wuhan. As one of the only empirical studies on the reform of the railway sector in China, this book will be of interest to students and scholars of China studies, Transport studies and Political Economy--

Title:  Psoriatic Arthritis  
Abstract: Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe inflammatory skin disease characterized by the presence of sterile pustules covering almost the entire body and systemic symptoms such as fever. Secukinumab, a fully human-recombinant anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody was indicated for psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis in Japan but is not yet investigated for GPP. In this phase III, open-label multicenter single arm study, the efficacy and safety of secukinumab as monotherapy or with co-medication was evaluated in 12 Japanese patients with GPP. All the patients received secukinumab 150 mg s.c. at baseline, week 1, 2, 3 and 4, and then every 4 weeks. Two non-responders were up-titrated to 300 mg. Change in GPP severity from baseline was evaluated by clinical global impression (CGI) categorized as ""worsened"", ""no change"", ""minimally improved"", ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"". Treatment success was achieved by 83.3% (n = 10) of patients at week 16 (primary end-point) with CGI evaluated as ""very much improved"" (n = 9) and "" much improved"" (n = 1). Moreover, the area of erythema with pustules improved as early as week 1 and resolved by week 16 in most of the patients. The improvements were sustained throughout 52 weeks. Over the 52-week treatment period, secukinumab was well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals. Nasopharyngitis, urticaria, diabetes mellitus and arthralgia were the frequent adverse events reported. The data from this study shows that secukinumab can become one of the potent treatment options for GPP.

Title: The disintegration of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Abstract: This book argues that the «international community» created and managed the dysfunctional state of Bosnia and Herzegovina by effectively rewarding ethnic cleansing, drawing up a transitional constitution which, in turn, generated a complex ethnifying polity incapable of independent reform. This constitution, which was only added as an annex to the Dayton Peace Agreement, has continued to encourage ethnification, understood in this book as the reproduction of imagined communities of descent. While accepting that foreign interference was necessary to end the war in the late 1990s, the book offers a critical review of the actions of the Office of the High Representative of the International Community (OHR) and other foreign actors since that period. It includes meticulous examination of hundreds of OHR decisions, as well as secret diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks revealing how the US embassy intervened in the country''s trade and foreign policy. Drawing on a process-sociological perspective, the book interrogates the notion of ethnicity and offers a radical new perspective on post-war state-building in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: The psychology of retirement 
Abstract: How can you make the most of retirement? How should you plan for retirement? What are the challenges of retirement and how can they be dealt with? The Psychology of Retirement looks at this life stage as a journey that involves challenges, opportunities, setbacks, periods of disenchantment and, often, exciting new beginnings. Taking a positive approach, the book explores how retirement provides opportunities to cultivate new friendships, interests and hobbies, consolidate and renegotiate long-held ones, and even re-invent oneself in a post-work environment. It also emphasizes the value of pre-retirement planning, and the importance of establishing new goals and purposes.

Title: The Cambridge introduction to Byron 
Abstract: Author of the most influential long poem of its era (Childe Harold's Pilgrimage) and the funniest long poem in European literature (Don Juan), Lord Byron was also the literary superstar of Romanticism, whose effect on nineteenth-century writers, artists, musicians and politicians - but also everyday readers - was second to none. His poems seduced and scandalized readers, and his life and legend were correspondingly magnetic, given added force by his early death in the Greek War of Independence. This introduction compresses his extraordinary life to manageable proportions and gives readers a firm set of contexts in the politics, warfare, and Romantic ideology of Byron's era. It offers a guide to the main themes in his wide-ranging oeuvre, from the early poems that made him famous (and infamous) overnight, to his narrative tales, dramas and the comic epic left incomplete at his death--

Title:  Image processing  
Abstract: During an earthquake, freestanding equipment and contents in a building may experience large complex 3D motion. Depending on the geometry, mass distribution, and support mechanism (e.g., wheels, casters, legs) of the object, this motion may include rolling, sliding, twisting, and rockingpotentially resulting in overturning or impact with building occupants, neighboring walls or other objects. Measuring this complex motion by traditional, contact-type displacement sensors is challenging. Owing to recent advances in video capture sensors and image processing techniques, vision-based motion tracking and measurement have been introduced as a practical, economical, and fairly accurate measuring method. This paper presents a procedure utilized to evaluate the accuracy of a consumer-grade camera for the purpose of measuring the motion of a piece of medical equipment during shake-table testing. The fixed-focal length camera considered in this study can capture video recordings with different resolution and frame rates. During experimental testing, the camera is positioned at a distance from the target (as it would be in a real application) to track the motion of four LED lights attached to the shake table. The capabilities of the camera are evaluated using as input a signal with varying frequency and amplitude. A wavelet approach is proposed and utilized in order to synchronize the vision-based displacement measurement with the output of the displacement transducer installed on the shake table, to be later used in accuracy assessments. Absolute and relative error curves are presented to evaluate the errors in the frequency range of interest for the actual experiments. Finally, contour plots are proposed that specify the displacement, velocity, and acceleration accuracy of vision-based measurements, which can be used in future applications.

Title: Corporate branding
Abstract: A strong corporate image has power in a competitive marketplace. Its influence on reputational value and customer decision-making is only now beginning to be understood. Interest in corporate branding is exploding as marketing academics and professionals begin to realise how it can boost business performance in measurable ways. For example, it promotes customer patronage without expensive advertising and raises profitability by enabling companies to leverage their brand image when buying from particular sources. Yet there are few empirical studies available to clarify its basic tenets and fewer still that help us understand corporate branding in different parts of the world. Existing books focus mainly on conceptual ideas and real-life examples. Corporate Branding: Areas, Arenas and Approaches is a unique take on corporate branding that provides a global overview through rigorous research of different geographical areas across industries. An international range of leading scholars contribute their coverage across three clear themes: Area: Geographical areas across the globe including the UK, US, Europe and Asia Arena: A variety of commercial and not-for-profit sectors, both B2B and B2C Approach: Methodological approaches to brand research design, including qualitative, quantitative, case studies, interpretivistic and social narrative. These three themes enable the reader to consider corporate branding from more perspectives and in more ways than any other corporate branding book. The result is an understanding of this strategically important, growing subject that can't be found anywhere else. This book is an essential read for any branding student or interested professional--

Title: An analysis of J. A. Hobson's Imperialism
Abstract: English economist John Hobson's 1902 Imperialism: A Study was an epoch-making study of the politics and economics of imperialism that shook imperialist beliefs to their core. A committed liberal, Hobson was deeply sceptical about the aims and claims of imperialistic thought at a time when Britain's empire held sway over a vast portion of the globe. In order to critique what he saw as a falsely reasoned and immoral political view, Hobson's book took a cuttingly analytical approach to the idea of imperialism--setting out to dissect and understand the arguments for empire before subjecting them to withering evaluation--a process that led him to the key insight that the then widely-accepted claim that imperialism was essentially a question of nationalism was, in fact, quite weak. Instead, Hobson's close analysis of the implicit and hidden reasons for imperialist projects demonstrated that, at root, they were all products of capitalism. It became increasingly clear to him that imperialism was less a political ideology, and more the product of the urgent need to open up new markets and remedy economic stagnation at home. Deeply provocative at the time, Hobson's book shows just how powerful the critical thinking skills of analysis and evaluation can be when applied to deconstruction of even the most widely accepted of ideas.--Provided by publisher.

Title: George Bernard Shaw
Abstract: George Bernard Shaw has been called the second greatest playwright in English (after William Shakespeare) and one of the inventors of modern celebrity as the most famous public intellectual of his time. Beginning in the 1880s, as a critic and as a playwright, he transformed British drama, bringing to it intellectual substance, ethical imperatives, and modernity itself, setting the theatrical course for the subsequent century. That his legacy endures seventy years after his death is testament to the prescience of his thinking and his prolific creativity. This Very Short Introduction looks at Shaw's life, starting with his upbringing in Ireland, and then takes a chronological approach through his works. Considering Shaw's committed antagonism on behalf of a range of socio-political issues; his use of comedy as a mode for communicating serious ideas; and his rhetorical style that pushes conventional boundaries, Christopher Wixson provides an overview of the creative evolution of core themes throughout Shaw's long career.

Title:  Hepatitis C  
Abstract: ObjectivesThe aim of the study was to examine the association between levels of past and current alcohol consumption and all-cause and liver-related mortality among people living with HIV (PLWH). MethodsA prospective cohort study of 1855 PLWH in Baltimore, MD was carried out from 2000 to 2013. We ascertained alcohol use by (1) self-report (SR) through a computer-assisted self interview, and (2) medical record abstraction of provider-documented (PD) alcohol use. SR alcohol consumption was categorized as heavy (men: >4 drinks/day or >14 drinks/week; women: >3 drinks/day or >7 drinks/week), moderate (any alcohol consumption less than heavy), and none. We calculated the cumulative incidence of liver-related mortality and fitted adjusted cause-specific regression models to account for competing risks. ResultsAll-cause and liver-related mortality rates (MRs) were 43.0 and 7.2 per 1000 person-years (PY), respectively. All-cause mortality was highest among SR nondrinkers with PD recent (6 months ago showed similar rates of liver-related mortality (HR = 1.06 and 2.00, respectively). ConclusionsAny heavy alcohol consumption was associated with all-cause mortality among HIV-infected individuals, while only recent heavy consumption was associated with liver-related mortality. Because mortality risk among nondrinkers varies substantially by drinking history, current consumption alone is insufficient to assess risk.

Title: The city
Abstract: The City: A World History tells the story of the rise and development of urban centers from ancient times to the twenty-first century. It begins with the establishment of the first cities in the Near East in the fourth millennium BCE, and goes on to examine urban growth in the Indus River Valley in India, as well as Egypt and areas that bordered the Mediterranean Sea. Athens, Alexandria, and Rome stand out both politically and culturally. With the fall of the Roman Empire in the West, European cities entered into a long period of waning and deterioration. But elsewhere, great cities-among them, Constantinople, Baghdad, Chang'an, and Tenochtitlan-thrived. In the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, urban growth resumed in Europe, giving rise to cities like Florence, Paris, and London. This urban growth also accelerated in parts of the world that came under European control, such as Philadelphia in the nascent United States. As the Industrial Revolution swept through in the nineteenth century, cities grew rapidly. Their expansion resulted in a slew of social problems and political disruptions, but it was accompanied by impressive measures designed to improve urban life. Meanwhile, colonial cities bore the imprint of European imperialism. Finally, the book turns to the years since 1914, guided by a few themes: the impact of war and revolution; urban reconstruction after 1945; migration out of many cities in the United States into growing suburbs; and the explosive growth of megacities in the developing world.

Title: The boundaries of realism in world literature 
Abstract: This book is a valuable theoretical and critical contribution to the study of realism inworld literature. Proceeding from the mimetic theories of the era of antiquity, and proceeding to explore formalists, structuralists, theories of possible worlds, and theories of simulation, Kvas points to the fictionality of (mimetic) realism, to literature and art as the creation of new, fictional aesthetic worlds, even when—as in the case of realism—there is a programmatic and practical inclination of such art and literature toward the world of the historical and the social—the real in the original sense of the word. This study will enable readers to confront, in a new and dependable manner, the issues of literary realism and its digressions into magical realism.

Title:  Prejudice  
Abstract: This article analyses the public responses in China to Shanghai's performance in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Based on data obtained from media accounts and other materials published between 2013 and 2016, the research findings show that the responses in China are generally reflective, measured and self-critical. Drawing upon Gadamer's notions of tradition', horizon' and prejudice', this paper contends that the responses reflect the prevailing worldviews in China that perceive Shanghai's education system to be academically rigorous but too exam-oriented and burdensome. It is further argued that Confucian knowledge traditions and structures in China shape the Chinese interpretations of the PISA assessment format, leading them to downplay Shanghai's success. This study introduces the metaphor of triadic eyes' and highlights the mediating effects of the local eyes' of policy actors in an era of global educational governance.

Title:  Thermodynamics  
Abstract: Accurate thermodynamic parameters improve RNA structure predictions and thus accelerate understanding of RNA function and the identification of RNA drug binding sites. Many viral RNA structures, such as internal ribosome entry sites, have internal loops and bulges that are potential drug target sites. Current models used to predict internal loops are biased toward small, symmetric purine loops, and thus poorly predict asymmetric, pyrimidine-rich loops with >6 nucleotides (nt) that occur frequently in viral RNA. This article presents new thermodynamic data for 40 pyrimidine loops, many of which can form UU or protonated CC base pairs. Uracil and protonated cytosine base pairs stabilize asymmetric internal loops. Accurate prediction rules are presented that account for all thermodynamic measurements of RNA asymmetric internal loops. New loop initiation terms for loops with >6 nt are presented that do not follow previous assumptions that increasing asymmetry destabilizes loops. Since the last 2004 update, 126 new loops with asymmetry or sizes greater than 2 x 2 have been measured. These new measurements significantly deepen and diversify the thermodynamic database for RNA. These results will help better predict internal loops that are larger, pyrimidine-rich, and occur within viral structures such as internal ribosome entry sites.

Title: The mechanics of wonder
Abstract: This is a sustained argument about the idea of science fiction by a renowned critic. Overturning many received opinions and sacred cows, it is both controversial and stimulating. Much of the controversy arises from Westfahl's resurrection of Hugo Gernsback - for decades a largely derided figure - as the true creator of science fiction. Following an initial demolition of earlier critics, Westfahl argues for Gernsback's importance. His argument is fully documented, showing a much greater familiarity with early American science fiction, particularly magazine fiction, than previous academic critics or historians. After his initial chapters on Gernsback, he examines the way in which the Gernsback tradition was adopted and modified by later magazine editors and early critics. This involves a re-evaluation of the importance of John W. Campbell to the history of science fiction which is possibly as important as his re-evaluation of Gernsback, as well as a very interesting critique of Robert Heinlein's Beyond the Horizon, one of the seminal texts of American science fiction. In conclusion, Westfahl uses the theories of Gernsback and Campbell to develop a descriptive definition of science fiction and he explores the ramifications of that definition.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Semiotics and fieldwork 
Abstract: Ethnographic fieldwork and formal linguistic analysis have traditionally been thought to be diametrically opposed. In this provocative analysis Peter Manning argues that these methods of qualitative research are complementary. After examining the potential benefits and limitations of each method of analysis, the author shows how a synthesis of the two is more powerful than either alone.

Title: Indigeneity, culture and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 
Abstract: This is the first scholarly book to examine the UN Sustainable Development Goals from an indigenous perspective. It refers to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and domestic instruments such as New Zealand's Tiriti o Waitangi to suggest how the goals could be revised to support self-determination as a more far-reaching and ambitious project than the goals currently imagine. The book draws on Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand experiences to analyse the goals' policy relevance to wealthy states and indigenous rights in established liberal democracies. Dominic O'Sullivan is Professor of Political Science at Charles Sturt University, Adjunct Professor at the Auckland University of Technology and Academic Associate at the University of Auckland. He is from the Te Rarawa and Ngati Kahuiwi of New Zealand, and this is his ninth book. The most recent, Sharing the Sovereign: Indigenous Peoples, Recognition, Treaties and the State was published by Palgrave in 2021.

Title:  Electrical circuits  
Abstract: A correct diagnosis of electrical circuits is very essential in industrial plants. An article deals with a recognition method of early fault detection of induction motor. The described approach is based on patterns recognition. Acoustic signals of specific induction motor are analyzed patterns. Acoustic signals include information about motor state. The analysis of the patterns was conducted for three states of induction motor using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), shortened method of frequencies selection (SMoFS-10) and Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM). The results of calculations suggest that the method is efficient and can be also used for diagnostic purposes.

Title: A theory about control 
Abstract: Moving beyond his 1989 book, Control: Sociology's Central Notion, Jack Gibbs develops in this new book a comprehensive theory of control in all its biological, technological, and human dimensions. His treatment goes beyond conventional ideas about social control to show why self-control and proximate control are essential to understanding human interaction. He also argues that thinking of control in terms of the counteraction of deviance is insufficient. Tests of Gibbs's control theory, based on data from sixty-six countries, add credence to his claim that control could be the central notion for sociology and perhaps for other social sciences.

Title:  Digital control  
Abstract: In many digital control systems, it is required to perform computation in a strictly periodic fashion to provide high control performance. System designers need to assign time slots that are infinitely repeated given a strict period for each task such that the time slots of different tasks do not overlap. While previous work has studied how to decide if a system is schedulable with a certain time slot assignment, it is still an unexplored area of how to select time slots for strictly periodic tasks to make them schedulable. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to solve the above problem. Our method explores the relations among task periods to improve the possibility of finding feasible start time configurations. Finally, we conduct experiments with randomly generated workload to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title:  Electricity  
Abstract: A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a very promising way to remove organic pollutants. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is a widely used agricultural pesticide. In this study, single-chamber and membrane-less soil MFCs were constructed. The HCB was degraded to pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB), and trichlorobenzene (TCB) in sequence by a reductive dechlorination process in soil MFCs. The influences of the external resistance, concentration of phosphate buffer, and electrode spacing in soil MFCs on the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were analyzed. The results showed that the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were increased when the external resistance decreased from 2000 to 20 (1, and also when the concentration of phosphate buffer increased. The anode area played a significant role in dechlorination of HCB. Altering the spacing of the reducing electrode resulted in a lower ohmic resistance in the soil MFCs. The ohmic resistance was negatively correlated with the removal efficiency and degradation rate (P < 0.05). In conclusion, HCB removal efficiency could be enhanced by soil MFCs, the performance of which was improved by a decrease in external resistance and internal resistance, and an increase in phosphate buffer concentration, rather than just by shortening the electrode spacing.

Title: The Lotus Sutra 
Abstract: Since its appearance in China in the third century, the Lotus Sutra has been regarded as one of the most illustrious scriptures in the Mahayana Buddhist canon. The object of intense veneration among generations of Buddhists in China, Korea, Japan, and other parts of East Asia, it has attracted more commentary than any other Buddhist scripture and has had a profound impact on the great works of Japanese and Chinese literature. Conceived as a drama of colossal proportions, the text takes on new meaning in Burton Watson's translation. Depicting events in a cosmic world that transcends ordinary concepts of time and space, the Lotus Sutra presents abstract religious concepts in concrete terms and affirms that there is a single path to enlightenment - that of the bodhisattva - and that the Buddha is not to be delimited in time and space. Filled with striking imagery. memorable parables, and countless revelations concerning the universal accessibility of Buddhahood, the Lotus Sutra has brought comfort and wisdom to devotees over the centuries and stands as a pivotal text in world literature. As Watson notes, The Lotus Sutra is not so much an integral work as a collection of religious texts, an anthology of sermons, stories and devotional manuals, some speaking with particular force to persons of one type or in one set of circumstances, some to those of another type or in other circumstances. This is no doubt one reason why it has had such broad and lasting appeal over the ages and has permeated so deeply into the cultures that have been exposed to it..

Title:  Weight Loss  
Abstract: Edible coatings (ECs) based on chitosan (CH), pullulan (PU), linseed (LM), nopal cactus (NM) and aloe mucilage (AM) were applied by layer-by-layer technique to preserve the quality and prolong the shelf-life of fresh-cut pineapple. Pineapples were washed, disinfected, dried and cut into 2 cm side cubes. Fresh-cut fruit was coated by dipping using four treatments (CH + PU, CH + LM, CH + NM and CH + AM), packed into polyethylene terephthalate containers and stored for 18 d at 4 degrees C. Uncoated fruit was used as control. Application of layer-by-layer ECs decreased (P < 0.05) the weight loss, pineapple softening, and, retarded the fall on total soluble solids content and color (L* and a*). CH + AM EC was effective in delaying (P0.05). Microbiological analyses demonstrated the effectiveness (P < 0.05) of the layer-by-layer ECs against spoilage microorganisms, L. monocytogenes and S. typhi. CH + PU EC was the most effective in controlling microbial levels. Sensory analysis demonstrated that layer-by-layer ECs helped to preserve (P < 0.05) the quality properties (color, odor, flavor, texture and overall acceptance). In conclusion, layer-by-layer ECs based on CH + PU, CH + LM, CH + NM and CH + AM improved the quality and prolonged the shelf-life of fresh-cut pineapple by six days compared with control.

Title:  Ambient Intelligence  
Abstract: Autonomy and adaptability are key features of intelligent agents. Many applications of intelligent agents, such as the control of ambient intelligence environments and autonomous intelligent robotic systems, require the processing of information coming in from many available sensors to produce adequate output responses in changing scenarios. Autonomy, in these cases, applies not only to the ability of the agent to produce correct outputs without human guidance, but also to its ubiquity and/or portability, low-power consumption and integrability. In this sense, an embedded electronic system implementation paradigm can be applied to the design of autonomous intelligent agents in order to satisfy the above mentioned characteristics. However, processing complex computational intelligence algorithms with tight delay constraints in resource-constrained and low power embedded systems is a challenging engineering problem. In this paper a single-chip intelligent agent based on a computationally efficient neuro-fuzzy information processing core is described. The system has been endowed with an information preprocessing module based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that permits a substantial reduction of the input space dimensionality with little loss of modeling capability. Moreover, the PCA module has been tested as a means to achieve deep adaptability in changing environment dynamics and to endow the agent with fault tolerance in the presence of sensor failures. For data driven trials and research, a data set obtained from an experimental intelligent inhabited environment has been used as a benchmark system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Parallel computing  
Abstract: A multiphysics simulation technique based on the finite element method is developed for the reliability analysis of interconnects. The multiphysics simulation characterizes multidisciplinary, including electrical, thermal, and mechanical, aspects of interconnects. It is well known that the major bottleneck preventing 3-D simulations from gaining further popularity is the computational efficiency in dealing with practically large-scale problems. To address this problem, the proposed multiphysics simulation is devised for analyzing large-scale problems with a significantly improved computational efficiency through utilizing a domain decomposition scheme called the finite element tearing and interconnecting, parallel computing, and the localized nature of thermal stresses in the interconnect structures. Both the capability and efficiency of the multiphysics simulation are demonstrated through analyzing large-scale interconnect structures including arrays of solder bumps and bonding wires. Detailed temperature distributions and localized stresses of large amplitude are obtained through the proposed simulation in a highly efficient manner.

Title:  Alzheimer's Disease  
Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the inter-rater variability of the visual interpretation of C-11-PiB PET images regarding the positivity/negativity of amyloid deposition that were obtained in a multicenter clinical research project, Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI). The results of visual interpretation were also compared with a semi-automatic quantitative analysis using mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio to the cerebellar cortex (mcSUVR). A total of 162 C-11-PiB PET scans, including 45 mild Alzheimer's disease, 60 mild cognitive impairment, and 57 normal cognitive control cases that had been acquired as J-ADNI baseline scans were analyzed. Based on visual interpretation by three independent raters followed by consensus read, each case was classified into positive, equivocal, and negative deposition (ternary criteria) and further dichotomized by merging the former two (binary criteria). Complete agreement of visual interpretation by the three raters was observed for 91.3% of the cases (Cohen kappa = 0.88 on average) in ternary criteria and for 92.3% (kappa = 0.89) in binary criteria. Cases that were interpreted as visually positive in the consensus read showed significantly higher mcSUVR than those visually negative (2.21 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.09, p < 0.001), and positive or negative decision by visual interpretation was dichotomized by a cut-off value of mcSUVR = 1.5. Significant positive/negative associations were observed between mcSUVR and the number of raters who evaluated as positive (rho = 0.87, p < 0.0001) and negative (rho = -0.85, p < 0.0001) interpretation. Cases of disagreement among raters showed generally low mcSUVR. Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect in C-11-PiB PET scans. Positive or negative decision by visual interpretation was dichotomized by a cut-off value of mcSUVR = 1.5. As some cases of disagreement among raters tended to show low mcSUVR, referring to quantitative method may facilitate correct diagnosis when evaluating images of low amyloid deposition.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:

Title:  Depression  
Abstract: The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale-8 (ASES-8) is a valid tool to measure patients' arthritis-specific self-efficacy. However, evidence about reliability and validity of the ASES-8 in Chinese arthritis patients is lacking. This study aimed to culturally adapt and test the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the ASES-8. Chinese ASES-8 was translated from original English version using translation and back-translation procedures. Validation survey was then conducted in a university-affiliated hospital by a set of questionnaires comprised Chinese ASES-8, pain-VAS, The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F), and Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) physical functioning subscale. A convenience sample of 134 patients with rheumatoid arthritis was recruited from the department of rheumatology. Validity was assessed by Pearson's correlation analysis and exploratory factor analysis. Reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha. Exploratory factor analysis extracted one dimension that explained of the 71.35% variation. Significant negative correlations were found between the ASES-8 and pain-VAS, HADS-D, HADS-A scores (r -0.487 to -0.656, p < 0.01), while positive correlations were found between the ASES-8 and SF-36 PH (r = 0.561, p < 0.01), FACIT-F (r = 0.660, p < 0.01). Excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.98) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.942) were demonstrated. The Chinese version of the ASES-8 had statistically acceptable levels of reliability and validity for assessing self-efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This disease-specific scale is particularly valuable for use among patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the Chinese population.

Title:  Molecular biology  
Abstract: Recent success in cancer immunotherapy (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD1/PD-L1) has confirmed the hypothesis that the immune system can control many cancers across various histologies, in some cases producing durable responses in a way not seen with many small molecule drugs. However, only less than 25% of all patients do respond to immunooncology drugs and several resistance mechanisms have been identified (e.g. T-cell exhaustion, overexpression of caspase-8 and beta-catenin, PD-1/PD-L1 gene amplification, MHC-I/II mutations). To improve response rates and to overcome resistance, novel second- and third-generation immuno-oncology drugs are currently evaluated in ongoing phase I/II trials (either alone or in combination) including novel inhibitory compounds (e.g. TIM-3, VISTA, LAG-3, IDO, KIR) and newly developed co-stimulatory antibodies (e.g. CD40, GITR, OX40, CD137, ICOS). It is important to note that co-stimulatory agents strikingly differ in their proposed mechanism of action compared with monoclonal antibodies that accomplish immune activation by blocking negative checkpoint molecules such as CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-1 or others. Indeed, the prospect of combining agonistic with antagonistic agents is enticing and represents a real immunologic opportunity to 'step on the gas' while 'cutting the brakes', although this strategy as a novel cancer therapy has not been universally endorsed so far. Concerns include the prospect of triggering cytokine-release syndromes, autoimmune reactions and hyper immune stimulation leading to activation-induced cell death or tolerance, however, toxicity has not been a major issue in the clinical trials reported so far. Although initial phase I/II clinical trials of agonistic and novel antagonistic drugs have shown highly promising results in the absence of disabling toxicity, both in single-agent studies and in combination with chemotherapy or other immune system targeting drugs; however, numerous questions remain about dose, schedule, route of administration and formulation as well as identifying the appropriate patient populations. In our view, with such a wealth of potential mechanisms of action and with the ability to fine-tune monoclonal antibody structure and function to suit particular requirements, the second and third wave of immuno-oncology drugs are likely to provide rapid advances with new combinations of novel immunotherapy (especially co-stimulatory antibodies). Here, we will review the mechanisms of action and the clinical data of these new antibodies and discuss the major issues facing this rapidly evolving field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title: Social work and the visual imagination
Abstract: Images are inscribed in the memory more easily than words, and some remain with the viewer for a lifetime. Combining hindsight, insight and foresight, the chapters in this book turn a spotlight onto various aspects of health, social work and socially engaged arts practice. The visual imagination is evoked in this book to help practitioners see beneath the surface of contentious and problematic issues facing human services today. Risk assessment, child sexual abuse, work-life balance, old age, dementia, substance misuse, recovery, sex work, homelessness, isolation, biography, death and dying, grief, loss, vulnerability, care, and the function of the museum as a preserver of memory, all come under the sustained gaze and examination of the contributors. Grounded in the arts and humanities, the visual sense as a gateway to empathy is explored throughout these chapters. References are included to visual art, curating dramatic performance, poetry, film, dance, photography, diary entries, and public exhibitions. In an age when people increasingly compose their lives by staring into various screens, this book celebrates the visual modality that can humanise services with ‘human-seeings’.

Title:  Analog signal processing  
Abstract: Several novel dispersion-engineered CRLH TL metamaterial analog signal processing systems, exploiting the broadband dispersive characteristics and design flexibility of CRLH TLs, are presented. These systems are either guided-wave or radiated-wave systems, and employ either the group velocity or the group velocity dispersion parameters. The systems presented are: a frequency tunable impulse delay line, a pulse-position modulator, a frequency discriminator and real-time Fourier tran former pulse generators, an analog real-time spectrum analyzer, a frequency resolved electrical gating, a spatio-temporal Talbot effect imager and analog true-time delayer. They represent a new class of impulse-regime metamaterial structures, while previously reported metamaterials were mostly restricted to the hormonic regime.

Title:  Parallel computing  
Abstract: In a variety of research areas, the weighted bag of vectors and the histogram are widely used descriptors for complex objects. Both can be expressed as discrete distributions. D2-clustering pursues the minimum total within-cluster variation for a set of discrete distributions subject to the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. D2-clustering has a severe scalability issue, the bottleneck being the computation of a centroid distribution, called Wasserstein barycenter, that minimizes its sum of squared distances to the cluster members. In this paper, we develop a modified Bregman ADMM approach for computing the approximate discrete Wasserstein barycenter of large clusters. In the case when the support points of the barycenters are unknown and have low cardinality, our method achieves high accuracy empirically at a much reduced computational cost. The strengths and weaknesses of our method and its alternatives are examined through experiments, and we recommend scenarios for their respective usage. Moreover, we develop both serial and parallelized versions of the algorithm. By experimenting with large-scale data, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of the new methods and investigate their convergence properties and numerical stability. The clustering results obtained on several datasets in different domains are highly competitive in comparison with some widely used methods in the corresponding areas.

Title: Magnitude Cartier
Abstract: This beautifully produced volume is dedicated to the new collection of high jewelry from Cartier. The rare and audacious association of precious and fine gemstones--like amazonite enhanced with diamonds or rubies, or an opal matrix paired with sapphires--creates striking combinations that form the foundation for a novel approach in high jewelry. This passion for the infinite diversity of stones and singular materials has been fundamental at Cartier since the house's inception. Such amalgamations generate an unexpected dialogue between contrasting elements--the rough with the ornamental, mineral with landscaped, bold colors with changing nuances, earth with cosmos. This exquisitely crafted volume--featuring elaborate production characteristics including multiple paper stocks, Swiss binding, an insert, and illustrations from the ateliers--celebrates the pioneering spirit of Cartier, its creativity, and the surprising beauty of the stones. --

Title:  Electrical network  
Abstract: We consider the design problem for a Marx generator electrical network, a pulsed power generator. We show that the components design can be conveniently cast as a structured real eigenvalue assignment with significantly lower dimension than the state size of the Marx circuit. Then we present two possible approaches to determine its solutions. A first symbolic approach consists in the use of Grobner basis representations, which allows us to compute all the (finitely many) solutions. A second approach is based on convexification of a nonconvex optimization problem with polynomial constraints. We also comment on the conjecture that for any number of stages the problem has finitely many solutions, which is a necessary assumption for the proposed methods to converge. We regard the proof of this conjecture as an interesting challenge of general interest in the real algebraic geometry field. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title:  Rheumatoid Arthritis  
Abstract: The objective of our study was to evaluate the T-helper (Th) and regulatory T (Treg) cell profile in ANCA-positive granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and its relation to disease activity. In a prospective study, we studied two groups of GPA patients: (i) disease flare (active-GPA, BVAS>6, n = 19), (ii) sustained remission ( 1-year prior enrollment, inactive-GPA, BVAS = 0, n = 18). 24 age-sex matched healthy subjects served as controls. Active-GPA patients were followed for 6 months and reevaluated during remission (early remission; n = 13). We analyzed subsets of Th-cells (flow cytometry), production of signature cytokines by in vitro stimulated lymphocytes, and broad spectrum of serum cytokines (Luminex). In all GPA patients we observed expansion of effector Th17 cells, and increased production of IL-17A by in vitro stimulated T cells, as compared to controls. Disease flare was characterized by marked reduction in Treg cells, whereas in sustained remission we showed expansion of both Treg and Th2 subset. Finally, analyzing the cytokine profile, we identified CCL23 and LIGHT, as potential biomarkers of active disease. We conclude that in GPA, expansion of Treg and Th2 lymphocytes in parallel to increased Th17 response is a characteristic feature of sustained remission. In contrast, Treg cells are markedly decreased in disease flare.

Title: War
Abstract: War has been a perennial feature of human history since ancient times, yet it remains a poorly understood phenomenon. It has done much to shape our world, from developing international governance, overthrowing leaders and inspiring social change, to destroying towns, dividing nations and breeding animosity. In this book, Dr. Aaron Edwards draws on a wide array of historical episodes to convey the complexity and human face of war. With eyewitness testimonies from different times, places and cultures, War: A Beginner's Guide offers a comprehensive overview of the political theories involved and invites readers to question whether violence is the most effective way to resolve disputes.

Title: 1922
Abstract: Empires fell. The Ottoman Empire collapsed after more than six centuries. The British Empire had reached its greatest extent but its heyday was over. The Irish Free State was declared and demands for independence in India grew. New nations and new politics came into existence. The Soviet Union was officially created and Mussolini's Italy became the first Fascist state.In the USA, Prohibition was at its height. The Hollywood film industry, although rocked by a series of scandals, continued to grow. A new mass medium - radio - was making its presence felt and, in Britain, the BBC was founded. In literature it was the year of peak modernism. Both T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land and James Joyce's Ulysses were first published in full.In society, already changed by the trauma of war and pandemic, the morals of the past seemed increasingly outmoded; new ways of behaving were making their appearance. The Roaring Twenties had begun to roar and the Jazz Age had arrived.1922 also saw the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi, the death of Marcel Proust, the election of a new pope, the release of the first major vampire movie, and the brief imprisonment in Munich of an obscure right-wing demagogue named Adolf Hitler.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services.

Title: Feeding cities
Abstract: There is enormous current interest in urban food systems, with a wide array of policies and initiatives intended to increase food security, decrease ecological impacts and improve public health. This volume is a cross-disciplinary and applied approach to urban food system sustainability, health, and equity. The contributions are from researchers working on social, economic, political and ethical issues associated with food systems. The book's focus is on the analysis of and lessons obtained from specific experiences relevant to local food systems, such as tapping urban farmers markets to address issues of food access and public health, and use of zoning to restrict the density of fast food restaurants with the aim of reducing obesity rates. Other topics considered include building a local food business to address the twin problems of economic and nutritional distress, developing ways to reduce food waste and improve food access in poor urban neighborhoods, and asking whether the many, and diverse, hopes for urban agriculture are justified.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

Title:  Eating disorders  
Abstract: Mental health problems implicitly and particularly pose questions about the tensions of the social world. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia, two eating behaviour disorders, are conceptualised in this article as exposing the social tensions particularly affecting young girls, and more frequently those from the middle and more affluent social classes. Why are these three structuring characteristics of social position female sex, comfortable social milieu, and ""youth"" interpretable in terms of social relations, and are they thus closely intertwined in these syndromes? Their configuration in eating disorders is atypical among health inequalities that more usually affect men and those from the poorer and older groups in the population. The sociological examination of these behavioural disorders shows that their foundations are not based on excessive conformity with the norms and values that would be expected of girls of the affluent classes but have more to do with a ""pathological use"" of the norms of excellence in response to the tensions encountered at this age.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Religious experience and lay society in T'ang China:
Abstract: The remains of Tai Fu's lost collection Kuang-i chi (The great book of marvels) preserve three hundred short tales of encounters with the other world. This study, the first of its kind, develops a style of close reading through which those tales give access to the lives of individuals in eighth-century China. Through the eyes of a mid-century county official emerges the picture of a complex lay society, served by a mixed priesthood of ritual practitioners, whose members' lives at all levels were profoundly shaped by their perceived experience of contact with the other world. It was a society embarking on fundamental change, and this book uses the sharp historical focus of Tai Fu's collection to study the dynamics of that change. Mixed in with reflections of ephemeral events and clear evidence of long-term continuity, it discovers signs of a transition from the beliefs and institutions of early mediaeval China towards those we now recognize as modern.

Title:  Parkinson's Disease  
Abstract: Background: As the popularity of transcriptomic analysis has grown, the reported lack of concordance between different studies of the same condition has become a growing concern, raising questions as to the representativeness of different study types, such as non-human disease models or studies of surrogate tissues, to gene expression in the human condition. Methods: In a comparison of 33 microarray studies of Parkinson's disease, correlation and clustering analyses were used to determine the factors influencing concordance between studies, including agreement between different tissue types, different microarray platforms, and between neurotoxic and genetic disease models and human Parkinson's disease. Results: Concordance over all studies is low, with correlation of only 0.05 between differential gene expression signatures on average, but increases within human patients and studies of the same tissue type, rising to 0.38 for studies of human substantia nigra. Agreement of animal models, however, is dependent on model type. Studies of brain tissue from Parkinson's disease patients (specifically the substantia nigra) form a distinct group, showing patterns of differential gene expression noticeably different from that in non-brain tissues and animal models of Parkinson's disease; while comparison with other brain diseases (Alzheimer's disease and brain cancer) suggests that the mixed study types display a general signal of neurodegenerative disease. A meta-analysis of these 33 microarray studies demonstrates the greater ability of studies in humans and highly-affected tissues to identify genes previously known to be associated with Parkinson's disease. Conclusions: The observed clustering and concordance results suggest the existence of a 'characteristic' signal of Parkinson's disease found in significantly affected human tissues in humans. These results help to account for the consistency (or lack thereof) so far observed in microarray studies of Parkinson's disease, and act as a guide to the selection of transcriptomic studies most representative of the underlying gene expression changes in the human disease.

Title:  Media violence  
Abstract: The evidence that exposure to media violence causes later aggression derives largely from observational (nonexperimental) studies augmented by short-term experimental studies. The authors review some of the difficulties in causal inference from observational, longitudinal data; examine the extent to which these seem relevant to the empirical work on exposure to televised violence published to date; and present a reanalysis of data from an especially influential study to address one of the more serious limitations of existing analyses. They conclude that the data give evidence that there is likely, although not certainly, a causal connection between exposure to televised violence and adult aggression. The authors close with a brief discussion of policy interventions designed to reduce exposure to violent TV.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

In this book, Mark Greeven, George Yip, and Wei Wei offer an insider's view of China's under-the-radar, globally competitive innovators. The authors, all experts on Chinese innovation, distinguish four types of innovators in China: pioneers , large companies that are globally known; hidden champions , midsize enterprises that are market leaders in their niches; underdogs , technology-driven ventures with significant intellectual property; and changemakers , newer firms characterized by digital disruption, exponential growth, and cross-industry innovations. They investigate what kinds of innovations these companies develop (product, process, or business model), their competitive strategies, and key drivers of innovation. They identify six typical ways Chinese entrepreneurs innovate, including swarm innovation (collectively pursuing opportunities) and rapid centralized decision making. Finally, they look at how Chinese innovators are going global, whether building R&D networks internationally or exporting disruptive business models. The book includes many examples of Chinese innovators and innovations, drawn from a range of companies--from pioneers to changemakers--including Alibaba, Haier, Hikvision, Malong Technology, Weihu Solar, Mobike, and Cheetah Mobile. Greeven, Yip, and Wei offer an essential guide to what makes China a heavyweight competitor in the global marketplace.  -- Provided by publisher.

Title:  Human Metabolism  
Abstract: A huge number of genes within the human genome code for proteins that mediate and/or control nutritional processes. Although a large body of information on the number of genes, on chromosomal localisation, gene structure and function has been gathered, we are far from understanding the orchestrated way of how they make metabolism. Nevertheless, based on the genetic information emerging on a daily basis, we are offered fantastic new tools that allow us new insights into the molecular basis of human metabolism under normal as well as pathophysiological conditions. Recent technological advancements have made it possible to analyse simultaneously large sets of mRNA and/or proteins expressed in a biological sample or to define genetic heterogeneity that may be important for the individual response of an organism to changes in its nutritional environment. Applications of the new techniques of genome and proteome analysis are central for the development of nutritional sciences in the next decade and its integration into the rapidly developing era of functional genomics.

Title: The culture of food in England, 1200-1500 
Abstract: In this revelatory work of social history, C.M. Woolgar shows that food in late-medieval England was far more complex, varied, and more culturally significant than we imagine today. Drawing on a vast range of sources, he charts how emerging technologies as well as an influx of new flavors and trends from abroad had an impact on eating habits across the social spectrum. From the pauper's bowl to elite tables, from early fad diets to the perceived moral superiority of certain foods, and from regional folk remedies to luxuries such as lampreys, Woolgar illuminates desire, necessity, daily rituals, and pleasure across four centuries.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: The dynamics of welfare markets
Abstract: This volume represents the beginning of a 'cross pollination' of different social scientific disciplines, bridging the boundaries between national and disciplinary epistemic communities in the worlds of European welfare markets. It maps the common ground and uncovers new research directions for the future study of actors, policies and institutions shaping the growth and dynamics of European welfare markets. The book defines welfare markets as politically shaped, regulated and state supported markets that provide social goods and services through the competitive activities of non-state actors. The chapters focus on what happens after states have initiated welfare markets, with equal weight given to the analysis of the agency of state actors and non-state actors in the contraction, stabilisation, and disruption of welfare markets. By focusing the analysis on two cases of welfare markets, private pensions and home-based domesticcare work, the contributions explore and compare the dynamics of different types of markets. The research will be of use to sociologists and scholars of social policy interested in the social dimension of welfare markets, political scientists and political economists, as well as diverse epistemic communities across the social sciences.

Since today all network services rely on the basic protocols, the use of data transmission capacities are not taken into account, untestable and redundant fields may become a big problem. All of the modern data protocols have vulnerabilities. An attacker can use the reserved fields or field use undocumented way. Regarding the mechanism of the transfer and detection methods described gears. The work is of great practical interest for the implementation of systems to detect and prevent intrusions and data leaks in it, the authors use the mechanisms of transmission and detection of transfers with using comparative evaluation of the fields in the packet with the values that are recommended in the standard protocol.

Title:  Relational databases  
Abstract: A NoSQL, also called a ""Non-Relational"" or ""Not only SQL,"" database system provides an approach to data management and database design for very large sets of distributed data and real-time web applications. A NoSQL database system is also a popular data storage for information retrieval because it supports better scalability, availability, and faster data access while comparing with traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). What the RDBMS data needs is predictable as its data is stored in structured tables by defining the relationship between the different columns. In contrary the data in NoSQL databases does not need to be stored in a structured or fixed fashion. When performance and realtime access are more concerned than consistency, such as indexing and retrieving large numbers of records, NoSQL databases are more suitable than relational databases. With their obvious advantages in better performance, scalability, and flexibility, NoSQL databases have been adopted lately by many small businesses as they are moving their increasing business data into the clouds. However, the research on the security of a specific NoSQL database system or NoSQL database systems in general is very limited. Although there are many storage advantages in NoSQL databases, the need of quick and easy access to data has been seriously affected by the security issue of NoSQL databases. This paper examines the maturity of security measures for MongoDB, a typical NoSQL database system, with aspects in both attack and defense at the code level. The experimental testing on NoSQL injections is performed with JavaScript and PHP. After the demonstration on how a server-side JavaScript injection attack against a NoSQL database system reveals the customer's private data, two methods are discussed in preventing this type of security problems from happening. It is believed that our study will help database developers not only realizing that NoSQL database systems are not designed with security as a priority but also learning how to build a security layer to their organizations' NoSQL applications to avoid NoSQL injections.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy.

It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Signal-flow graph  
Abstract: In the Power Plant Simulation System, Fluid network is widely present. Model accuracy largely determines the merits of the simulation system. The concept of signal flow graph has been introduced into the mechanism modeling process to describe the fluid network. Various structures in the fluid network are classified as node and branch, and the algorithm relationship of node's pressure and According to identify the unknown parameters in the model using the PSO, the influence from parameters of PSO to the process of optimization could be studied. Then the range of unknown parameters could be determined. Optimization could be accelerated, so as to achieve optimal results.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Antisocial personality disorder  
Abstract: Alcohol and drug use are commonly associated with the experience of homelessness. In order to better understand this, we explored the prevalence of drug and alcohol use as it related to successful re-housing within a sample of first-time single homeless adults at municipal shelters. From within this sample, we compared the features of recurrent homelessness with those of chronic homelessness and of being stably housed. We interviewed 344 subjects upon shelter entry and followed each one every six months for 18 months using standardized social and mental health measures. We analyzed baseline assessments relative to housing experiences during follow-up using Chi square and multinomial logistic regression. Eighty-one percent (N = 278) obtained housing over 18 months, of which 23.7 % (N = 66) experienced homelessness again. Recurrent homelessness was more common among those with a high school education and if initially re-housed with family. Bivariate analysis resulted in the observation of the highest rate of alcohol and other drug use among this recurrent group and multinomial logistic regression supported this only with the coupling of arrest history and diagnosed antisocial personality disorder. With relatively high rates of recurrent homelessness, there were differences between subjects who experienced recurrent homelessness compared to those who were stably housed and with chronic homelessness. That alcohol and other substance use disorders were associated with recurrent homelessness only if they were linked to other risk factors highlights the complexity of causes for homelessness and a resultant need to organize them into constellations of causal risk factors. Consistent with this, there should be initiatives that span bureaucratic boundaries so as to flexibly meet multiple complex service needs, thus improving outcomes concerning episodes of recurrent homelessness.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

One example is to think of Confucianism in terms of the views attributed to one representative of the tradition, such as Kongzi (Confucius) (551-479 BCE) or Mengzi (Mencius) (372 - 289 BCE) or one school or strand of the tradition, most often the strand or tradition associated with Mengzi or, in the later tradition, that formed around the commentaries and interpretation of Zhu Xi (1130-1200). Another such tendency is to think of Confucianism in terms of its manifestations in only one country; this is almost always China for the obvious reasons that China is one of the most powerful and influential states in the world today. A third tendency is to present Confucianism in terms of only one period or moment in the tradition; for example, among ethical and political philosophers, pre-Qin Confucianism--usually taken to be the writings attributed to Kongzi, Mengzi, and, if we are lucky, Xunzi (479-221 BCE)--often is taken as Confucianism. These and other forms of essentialism and idealism have led to a widespread and deeply entrenched impression that Confucianism is thoroughly homogenous and monolithic (these often are facts mustered to support the purportedly oppressive, authoritarian, and constricted nature of the tradition); such impressions can be found throughout East Asia and dominate in the West. This is quite deplorable for it gives us no genuine sense of the creatively rich, philosophically powerful, highly variegated, and still very much open-ended nature of the Confucian tradition. This volume addresses this misconstrual and misrepresentation of Confucianism by presenting a philosophically critical account of different Confucian thinkers and schools, across place (China, Korea, and Japan) and time (the 10th to 19th centuries).

Title: Further reading 
Abstract: What does reading mean in the twenty-first century? As other disciplines challenge literary criticism's authority to answer this question, English professors themselves are defining new alternatives to close reading and to interpretation more generally. Further Reading brings together thirty commissioned essays drawing on approaches as different as formalism, historicism, neuroscience, disability, and computation. Contributors take up the following questions: What do we mean when we talk about reading today? How are reading techniques evolving in the digital era? What is the future of reading? This book foregrounds reading as a topic worthy of investigation in its own right rather than as a sub-section of histories of the book, sociologies of literacy, or theories of literature. As our knowledge of reading changes in step with the media and the scholarly tools used to apprehend it, a more precise understanding of this topic is crucial to the discipline's future. This collection therefore seeks to introduce new ways of conceptualizing the term's forms, boundaries, and uses. Its contributors bring varied vocabularies to bear on the contested nature and continued importance of reading, within the academy and beyond--

Title:  Rainwater Harvesting  
Abstract: Rain barrels can be technically shared through social practices or mutual agreement between individual households. This study proposes the evaluation system for a rain barrel sharing network (RBSN) considering three performance criteria of reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability, under plausible climate change scenarios. First, this study shows how the system can be improved in terms of the performance criteria using historical daily rainfall data based on the storage-reliability-yield relationship. This study then examined how the benefits from RBSN are affected by climate change after 100 years. Three climate change scenarios (A1B, A2 and B2) and three global circulation models were used for this purpose. The results showed that the reliability and vulnerability are improved due to sharing and their improvements become larger under climate change conditions. In contrast, the resiliency reduces slightly due to sharing and its reduction is attenuated under climate change conditions. In particular, vulnerability will be reduced significantly under climate change. These results suggest that the sharing of various water resources systems can be an effective climate change adaptation strategy that reduces vulnerability and increases the reliability of the system.

Title:  System identification  
Abstract: We present a new approach to Model Predictive Control (MPC) oriented experiment design for the identification of systems operating in closed-loop. The method considers the design of an experiment by minimizing the experimental cost, subject to probabilistic bounds on the input and output signals due to physical limitations of actuators, and quality constraints on the identified model. The excitation is done by intentionally adding a disturbance to the loop. We then design the external excitation to achieve the minimum experimental effort while we are also taking care of the tracking performance of MPC. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by employing robust MPC during the experiment. The problem is then defined as an optimization problem. However, the aforementioned constraints result in a non-convex optimization which is relaxed by using results from graph theory. The proposed technique is evaluated through a numerical example showing that it is an attractive alternative for closed-loop experiment design. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: The acquisition of complex sentences 
Abstract: This book presents the first comprehensive study of how children acquire complex sentences. Drawing on observational data from English-speaking children aged from two to five, Holger Diessel investigates the acquisition of infinitival and participial complement clauses, finite complement clauses, finite and non-finite relative clauses, adverbial clauses, and co-ordinate clauses. His investigation shows that the development of complex sentences originates from simple, non-embedded sentences, and that two different developmental pathways can be distinguished: complex sentences including complement and relative clauses evolve from simple sentences that are gradually expanded to multiple clause constructions; and complex sentences including adverbial and co-ordinate clauses develop from simple sentences that are integrated into a specific biclausal unit. He argues that the acquisition process is determined by a variety of factors: the frequency of the various complex sentences in the ambient language, the semantic and syntactic complexity of the emerging constructions, the communicative functions of complex sentences, and the social-cognitive development of the child.--BOOK JACKET.

Title:  Social cognition  
Abstract: Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience marked challenges with social function by definition, but few modifiable predictors of social functioning in ASD have been identified in extant research. This study hypothesized that deficits in social cognition and motor function may help to explain poor social functioning in individuals with ASD. Method: Cross-sectional data from 108 individuals with ASD and without intellectual disability ages 9 through 27.5 were used to assess the relationship between social cognition and motor function, and social functioning. Results: Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that greater social cognition, but not motor function, was significantly associated with better social functioning when controlling for sex, age, and intelligence quotient. Post-hoc analyses revealed that better performance on second-order false belief tasks was associated with higher levels of socially adaptive behavior and lower levels of social problems. Conclusions: Our findings support the development and testing of interventions that target social cognition in order to improve social functioning in individuals with ASD. Interventions that teach generalizable skills to help people with ASD better understand social situations and develop competency in advanced perspective taking have the potential to create more durable change because their effects can be applied to a wide and varied set of situations and not simply a prescribed set of rehearsed situations.

Title:  Social cognition  
Abstract: Achieving false belief understanding is an important cognitive milestone that allows children to understand that thoughts and reality can differ. Researchers have found that low-income children score significantly lower than middle-income children on false belief understanding but have not examined why this difference exists. We hypothesized that children's language and parent discipline mediate the income-false belief relation. Participants were 174 3- to 6-year-olds. False belief understanding was significantly correlated with family income, children's vocabulary, parents' self reported discussion of children's behavior, discussion of emotions, and power assertion. Family income had a significant indirect effect on false belief understanding through children's vocabulary and parent discipline when examined independently, but only through children's vocabulary when using parallel multiple mediation. This study contributes to our knowledge of individual differences in false belief understanding. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Materials Engineering  
Abstract: Predicting engineering properties of materials prior to their synthesis enables the integration of their design into the overall engineering process. In this context, the present article discusses the foundation and requirements of software platforms for predicting materials properties through modeling and simulation at the electronic, atomistic, and mesoscopic levels, addressing functionality, verification, validation, robustness, ease of use, interoperability, support, and related criteria. Based on these requirements, an assessment is made of the current state revealing two critical points in the large-scale industrial deployment of atomistic modeling, namely (i) the ability to describe multicomponent systems and to compute their structural and functional properties with sufficient accuracy and (ii) the expertise needed for translating complex engineering problems into viable modeling strategies and deriving results of direct value for the engineering process. Progress with these challenges is undeniable, as illustrated here by examples from structural and functional materials including metal alloys, polymers, battery materials, and fluids. Perspectives on the evolution of modeling software platforms show the need for fundamental research to improve the predictive power of models as well as coordination and support actions to accelerate industrial deployment.

Title:  False memories  
Abstract: The source-monitoring paradigm suggests that dreams could be an important source of naturally occurring false memories. However, the malleability of memories for dreams remains to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of suggestions on subsequent dream recall. Immediate dream recall collected in a sleep laboratory was compared with long-term recall 1 to 2 weeks later. Standard recall was also compared with hypnotic recall. Suggested elements were reported by 15% of the 26 participants. The hypnotic condition showed no differential effect. It was also found that between 3% and 7% of the dreams reported in long-term recall were probably naturally occurring false memories of dreams. These findings suggest that situations of misinformation can easily elicit false memories of specific dreams.

Title: The Decline and Fall of Canada?
Abstract: The New York Times has recently run a piece pondering the renowned nation of Canada, and whether it has fallen from its once lofty heights of international greatness.    ""A country is not just a health system.""  This is the sentiment of one of a few Canadian authors recently lamenting the decline of Canadian engagement around the world.  The question then becomes: what makes a nation great?  Why would Canadians resent the place of  their placid and peaceful country?  And, what does this say about the roles taken on by other influential nations around the world?

Title:  Water Pollution  
Abstract: Water scarcity, pertaining to many interrelated issues e.g. rapid urbanisation and increasing water pollution, has been acknowledged around the world. Water reuse has emerged as a viable water conservation measure to satisfy water demand in many communities. Among the diversity of wastewater treatment processes, membrane assisted treatment technologies have been employed for different water reuse scenarios. In this regard, one of the most critical problems is how to select an appropriate membrane technology for a water reuse scenario. This research therefore develops a decision making framework for selection of wastewater treatment technology. The framework is applied to different non-potable reuse scenarios in South African cities and suburban areas by employing a multi criteria analysis method. The results show that this approach is able to provide a systematic and rigorous analysis which can help in comparing and selecting wastewater technologies.

Title: The lexicogrammar of adjectives
Abstract: After a thorough survey of the relevant literature, Gordon Tucker provides a linguistic description of the meanings and forms of the adjectives themselves the structures that occur around them and the functions that such units perform as elements of other units (such as the clause and the nominal group). The Lexicogrammar of Adjectives constitutes a major descriptive addition to our knowledge of the value of 'lexis as most delicate grammar'. It is a major contribution to the theoretical modelling of language in general and of words in particular. Its conclusions are important both for systemic functional linguistics and for linguistic theory in general.--BOOK JACKET.

Title: Win-win
Abstract: The strategies for school improvement detailed in this book are based on the theories of W. Edwards Deming, who was known as the father of the quality movement and was hugely influential in post-WWII Japan. He is most well-known for his theories of management. Win-Win offers real-world strategies to education leaders of improvement, based on Demings' System of Profound Knowledge. A leader of improvement does not need to be expert in the four components of profound knowledge, but they do need to understand the basic theory, their interconnectedness, and why they are necessary for these efforts. Win-Win provides this basic understanding. This book equips the reader with the knowledge and skills needed to harness the power of the System of Profound Knowledge to improve the performance of schools systems, students, and teachers. It can be used in a variety of classrooms in Colleges of Education, and it is the perfect teaching tool in professional development efforts. --

Title:  Smoking Cessation  
Abstract: Background: Services to treat tobacco dependence are not readily available to smokers in low-middle income countries (LMICs) where smoking prevalence remains high. We are conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of two strategies for implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in 26 community health centers (CHCs) in Viet Nam. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), prior to implementing the trial, we conducted formative research to (1) identify factors that may influence guideline implementation and (2) inform further modifications to the intervention that may be necessary to translate a model of care delivery from a high-income country (HIC) to the local context of a LMIC. Methods: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with CHC medical directors, health care providers, and village health workers (VHWs) in eight CHCs (n = 40). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and translated into English. Two qualitative researchers used both deductive (CFIR theory driven) and inductive (open coding) approaches to analysis developed codes and themes relevant to the aims of this study. Results: The interviews explored four out of five CFIR domains (i.e., intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, and individual characteristics) that were relevant to the analysis. Potential facilitators of the intervention included the relative advantage of the intervention compared with current practice (intervention characteristics), awareness of the burden of tobacco use in the population (outer setting), tension for change due to a lack of training and need for skill building and leadership engagement (inner setting), and a strong sense of collective efficacy to provide tobacco cessation services (individual characteristics). Potential barriers included the perception that the intervention was more complex (intervention characteristic) and not necessarily compatible (inner setting) with current workflows and staffing historically designed to address infectious disease prevention and control rather than chronic disease prevention and competing priorities that are determined by the MOH (outer setting). Conclusions: In this study, CFIR provided a valuable framework for evaluating factors that may influence implementation of a systems-level intervention for tobacco control in a LMIC and understand what adaptations may be needed to translate a model of care delivery from a HIC to a LMIC.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Philosophical method
Abstract: What are philosophers trying to achieve? How can they succeed? Does philosophy make progress? Is it in competition with science, or doing something completely different, or neither?Timothy Williamson tackles some of the key questions surrounding philosophy in new and provocative ways, showing how philosophy begins in common sense curiosity, and develops through our capacity to dispute rationally with each other. Discussing philosophy's ability to clarify our thoughts, he explains why such clarification depends on the development of philosophical theories, and how those theories can be tested by imaginative thought experiments, and compared against each other by standards similar to those used in the natural and social sciences. He also shows how logical rigor can be understood as a way of enhancing the explanatory power of philosophical theories. Drawing on the history of philosophy to provide a track record of philosophical thinking's successes and failures, Williamson overturns widely held dogmas about the distinctive nature of philosophy in comparison to the sciences, demystifies its methods, and considers the future of the discipline.From thought experiments, to deduction, to theories, this very short introduction will cause you to totally rethink what philosophy is.

Title:  Distributed computing  
Abstract: We analyze controllability properties for a class of bilinear interconnected systems, consisting of networks of linear systems, where the coupling parameters act as control variables. We characterize the system Lie algebra of the resulting bilinear control systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for accessibility are derived in terms of the underlying interconnection graph. Our results generalize earlier work by Brockett on controllability of bilinear output feedback systems, as well as recent work of Costello and Egerstedt on the control of information-exchange networks for distributed computing.

Title: Advertising, values and social change
Abstract: This book provides a snapshot of the major social, cultural and economic changes that have taken place in the contemporary consumer society following the global financial crisis of 2008. It discusses brands, consumption patterns and advertising, and highlights their symbolic component. Markets are conversations, as the Cluetrain Manifesto pointed out as early as 2000, and this is all the more so today in our increasingly digitalized society. Advertising, therefore, needs to attune products to the most interesting conversations, those that are consistent with the new sensibility of the individual, identifying the languages which reflect most closely the new values and which are most useful for effective storytelling. The analysis here focuses on Italian advertising, but the language categories described are in tune with the new Zeitgeist, which, faced with the challenge of climate change and the crisis of unlimited economic growth, demands a more informed and responsible approach to consumption globally. The book is, therefore, useful for those working in corporate communication, advertising agencies, universities and Italian cultural organizations.

Title:  Data structures  
Abstract: This essay examines the consequences of the so-called 'big data' technologies in biomedicine. Analyzing algorithms and data structures used by biologists can provide insight into how biologists perceive and understand their objects of study. As such, I examine some of the most widely used algorithms in genomics: those used for sequence comparison or sequence mapping. These algorithms are derived from the powerful tools for text searching and indexing that have been developed since the 1950s and now play an important role in online search. In biology, sequence comparison algorithms have been used to assemble genomes, process next-generation sequence data, and, most recently, for 'precision medicine.' I argue that the predominance of a specific set of text-matching and pattern-finding tools has influenced problem choice in genomics. It allowed genomics to continue to think of genomes as textual objects and to increasingly lock genomics into 'big data'-driven text-searching methods. Many 'big data' methods are designed for finding patterns in human-written texts. However, genomes and other' omic data are not human-written and are unlikely to be meaningful in the same way.

Title:  Seasonal affective disorder  
Abstract: Sleep and circadian functioning has been of particular interest to researchers focused on improving treatments for psychiatric illness. The goal of the present paper is to highlight the exciting research that utilizes basic sleep and circadian science as building blocks for intervention in the mood disorders. The reviewed evidence suggests that the sleep and circadian systems are a) disrupted in the mood disorders and linked to symptoms, b) open systems that can be modified, c) the focus of interventions which have been developed to effectively treat sleep disturbance within mood disorders, and d) intimately linked with mood, such that improvements in sleep are associated with improvements in mood. Although significant positive treatment effects are evident, more research is needed to fill the gap in our basic understanding of the relationship between sleep and mood.

Title:  Hereditary Angioedema  
Abstract: Introduction: Angioedema is a localized and self-limiting edema of the subcutaneous and submucosal tissue. Hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is the best characterized form of hereditary angioedema. In C1-INH-HAE, the reduced plasma levels of C1-INH cause instability of the contact system with release of bradykinin, the key mediator of angioedema. C1-INH-HAE is characterized by recurrent skin swelling, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening upper airways obstruction. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms leading from C1-INH deficiency to angioedema allowed the development of several therapies. Areas covered: The aim of this review article is to discuss the safety of currently available treatments of C1-INH-HAE. The authors give an insight on the mechanism of action and safety profile of drugs for treatment of acute attacks and for short- and long-term prophylaxis. Evidence from systematic reviews, clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case reports is summarized in this review. Expert opinion: C1-INH-HAE is a disabling, life-threatening condition that lasts life-long. Different therapeutic approaches with different drugs provide significant benefit to patients. Safety profiles of these therapies are critical for optimal therapeutic decision and need to be known by C1-INH-HAE treating physicians for appropriate risk/benefit evaluation.

Title: On Louise Glück
Abstract: On Louise Glück features essays by leading critics, poets, and scholars that explore the work of recent U.S. poet laureate Louise Glück. Glück, author of nine books of poetry, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Wild Iris, is noted for her searing honesty and compelling first-person personae. Though compared to world-famous verse by Sappho and Dickinson, Glück's poetry has remained curiously undigested among readers of contemporary poetry for some time. On Louise Glück gathers for the first time a diverse array of essays by the leading critics of this preeminent poet. Featuring a probing, extended interview with Glück, On Louise Glück traces the critical reception of her work and offers new insights into her imaginative, mysterious poetry.

Title: Rakes, highwaymen, and pirates
Abstract: Erin Mackie explores the shared histories of the modern polite English gentleman and other less respectable but no less celebrated eighteenth-century masculine types: the rake, the highwayman, and the pirate. She traces the emergence of these character types to the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, when traditional aristocratic authority was increasingly challenged. She argues that the development of the modern polite gentleman as a male archetype can only be fully comprehended when considered alongside figures of fallen nobility, which, although criminal, were also glamorous enough to reinforce the same ideological order. In Evelina's Lord Orville, Clarissa's Lovelace, Rookwood's Dick Turpin, and Caleb Williams's Falkland, Mackie reads the story of the ideal gentleman alongside that of the outlaw, revealing the parallel lives of these seemingly contradictory characters. Synthesizing the histories of masculinity, manners, and radicalism, Rakes, Highwaymen, and Pirates offers a fresh perspective on the eighteenth-century aristocratic male.--BOOK JACKET.

Abstract: A fascinating and beautifully illustrated volume that explains what street trees tell us about humanity's changing relationship with nature and the city Today, cities around the globe are planting street trees to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, as landscape historian Sonja Dumpelmann explains, the planting of street trees in cities to serve specific functions is not a new phenomenon. In her eye-opening work, Dumpelmann shows how New York City and Berlin began systematically planting trees to improve the urban climate during the nineteenth century, presenting the history of the practice within its larger social, cultural, and political contexts.

Title:  HIV/AIDS  
Abstract: Objective: The study aims to determine whether cystatin C is associated with HIV disease and HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (NCI). Methods: Participants included 124 (HIV+ n = 77; HIV- n = 47) older adults (age >= 50 years) examined at the University of California, San Diego HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program. Cystatin C, a biomarker of kidney functioning that has been linked to poor health outcomes, was measured in blood. Participants completed a comprehensive neurocognitive assessment that was used to define both global and domain NCI. Results: The HIV+ group had significantly higher cystatin C concentrations than the HIV- group (d = 0.79 P= 0.75 mg/L were associated with NCI in the HIV+ group. Using this binary variable and including relevant covariates, multivariate modeling confirmed that NCI was associated with higher cystatin C levels (OR = 3.0; P = 0.03). Conclusions: Our results confirm that HIV+ older adults have higher cystatin C than HIV- older adults and further identify that cystatin C may be associated with NCI in this population, particularly if they use tenofovir. This blood biomarker may be a useful clinical tool to identify older HIV+ persons at greater risk for cognitive decline.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Mind design and minimal syntax 
Abstract: This book introduces generative grammar as an area of study and asks what it tells us about the human mind. Wolfram Hinzen lays the foundation for the unification of modern generative linguistics with the philosophies of mind and language. He introduces Chomsky's program of a 'minimalist' syntax as a novel explanatory vision of the human mind. He explains how the Minimalist Program originated in work in cognitive science, biology, linguistics, and philosophy, and examines its implications for work in these fields. He considers the way the human mind is designed when seen as an arrangement of structural patterns in nature, and argues that its design is the product not so much of adaptive evolutionary history as of principles and processes that are ahistorical and internalist in character.--BOOK JACKET.

Title: Mastering endgame strategy 
Abstract: Study brings wisdom. Practice brings perfection. Following the highly acclaimed Mastering Chess Strategy and Mastering Opening Strategy, this book completes a trilogy of strategy books by Grandmaster and renowned chess teacher Johan Hellsten. In his new work Hellsten focuses exclusively on endgame play and covers every type of endgame: pawn, rook, minor piece and queen endgames. He examines not only the many fundamental positions that everyone needs to know, but also the key themes and characteristics of successful endgame play, including activity, creating and exploiting weaknesses, active and passive defence, fortresses and technique. Just like his previous two books, Mastering Endgame Strategy is a product of Hellsten's many years' work as a full-time chess teacher and is specifically designed as part of a structured training programme to improve strategic thinking. In addition to the many examples there's an abundance of carefully selected exercises which allow readers to monitor their progress and put into practice what they have just learned. Following such a course is an ideal way for players of all standards to improve.

Title:  Parenting  
Abstract: Background: Partner education during pregnancy may be able to prevent postnatal mental health problems, and support expectant fathers in their transition to parenthood. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of prenatal childbirth education among partners of pregnant women, particularly regarding paternal postnatal mental health and couple relationship. Methods: We searched Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, and CENTRAL using terms such as ""partners of pregnant women,"" ""education,"" and ""prenatal support."" Searches were limited to randomized trials. Results: We included 11 trials out of 13 reports that addressed the following topics: childbirth preparation, couple relationship, infants and parenting, postpartum psychosocial issues, and housework sharing. Overall risk of bias was low or unclear. Study outcomes, including parents' mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, distress), couple relationship, parents' transition adjustment and parenting stress, and parents' satisfaction with their experience of childbirth and prenatal childbirth education programs were reported. Limitations: The studies included in this review were very diverse regarding intervention intensity and content, outcome types, measurement tools, and outcome timing. This impeded evaluation of the interventions' effectiveness. Conclusion: No sufficient evidence was identified that prenatal childbirth education for partners of pregnant women protects against paternal postnatal depression and couple relationship; however, paternal postnatal mental health is important to maternal and perinatal healthcare. The results of this review suggest that further research and intervention are required to provide partners of pregnant women with evidence-based information and support whole families during the perinatal period.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Cyber security management
Abstract: Cyber Security Management: A Governance, Risk and Compliance Framework by Peter Trim and Yang-Im Lee has been written for a wide audience. Derived from research, it places security management in a holistic context and outlines how the strategic marketing approach can be used to underpin cyber security in partnership arrangements. The book is unique because it integrates material that is of a highly specialized nature but which can be interpreted by those with a non-specialist background in the area. Indeed, those with a limited knowledge of cyber security will be able to develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject and will be guided into devising and implementing relevant policy, systems and procedures that make the organization better able to withstand the increasingly sophisticated forms of cyber attack. The book includes a sequence-of-events model; an organizational governance framework; a business continuity management planning framework; a multi-cultural communication model; a cyber security management model and strategic management framework; an integrated governance mechanism; an integrated resilience management model; an integrated management model and system; a communication risk management strategy; and recommendations for counteracting a range of cyber threats. Cyber Security Management: A Governance, Risk and Compliance Framework simplifies complex material and provides a multi-disciplinary perspective and an explanation and interpretation of how managers can manage cyber threats in a pro-active manner and work towards counteracting cyber threats both now and in the future.

Title:  Electrical network  
Abstract: The ITER pulsed power electrical network (PPEN) supplies the superconducting magnets and the heating and current drive systems. During the experimental pulses, about several hundreds of seconds long, active power consumption of 500 MW and reactive one of 950 Mvar are expected. The ITER power supply system is very large and complex, and a careful design is required to assure a safe operation. Stability of ITER PPEN has been already investigated in recent studies by numerical simulation and analytical methods. Now, a new dynamic analytical model of the ITER power supply system is being developed, based on the state-space theoretical approach, which allows the application of the linear control theory to study the stability of the whole system. For each subsystem of the ITER power supply, a state-space model was developed, and in this paper, the ac/dc converter model is presented and validated for six and twelve pulse operation, and circulating current mode.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Sadomasochism and the BDSM community in the United States
Abstract: Sadomasochism and the BDSM Community in the United States: Kinky People Unite chronicles the development of sadomasochistic sexuality and its communities in the United States from the post-war period to the present day. Having evolved from scattered networks of sadomasochists to a coherent body bound by shared principles of safe, sane, consensual, activists worked to transform popular perceptions of their community, end its routine harassment by law enforcement, and win inclusion in American society. Often paralleling the work of LGBTQ activists, people who engaged in BDSM (Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission, and Sadism and Masochism) transformed both their own sexual practices and how outsiders perceived them, successfully changing popular perceptions of them from fascists, murderers, and outlaws to people living an alternative lifestyle. The development of this community highlights the interactions of people of different sexual orientations within a sexual community, the influence of various campaigns for sexual freedom, and the BDSM community's influence on popular perceptions of sexuality and sexual freedom. The text's historical perspective gives depth and texture to a specific dimension of American history of sexuality. This book will be of interest to students and scholars in the history of sexuality. It's clear and direct approach offers an important and useful chronology of a movement that has long been neglected--

Title: Pride and prejudice 
Abstract: Pride and Prejudice has delighted generations of readers with its unforgettable cast of characters, carefully choreographed plot, and a hugely entertaining view of the world and its absurdities. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighbourhood, the lives of Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and menide down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight. If Elizabeth Bennet returns again and again to her letter from Mr Darcy, readers of the novel are drawn even more irresistibly by its captivating wisdom. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.

Title:  Depression  
Abstract: There is wide variation in reported impact of caring on caregiver wellbeing, and often a negative appraisal of caregiving. Researchers are beginning to question the robustness of the evidence base on which negative appraisals are based. The present study aimed to draw on data from a population-representative sample to describe the health, quality of life and impact of caring of informal caregivers of people with an intellectual disability. Informal carers of people with intellectual disability (N = 260) were identified among 2199 carers in the English Survey of Carers in Households 2009/10. Generalised estimating equations explored the association between socio-demographic and caring profile with quality of life, physical health status, and impact on psychological health and personal life. Compared to other caregivers, providing care to a person with intellectual disability was not associated with reduced quality of life. There was an 82% increased risk of reporting poorer health status, even though poorer health was not likely to be attributed to caregiving. A higher risk of negative impact on personal life was seen in comparison with the wider group of caregivers, but not in comparison with more similar-sized caregiver groups (mental health or dementia). Carers of people with intellectual disability were more likely to be struggling financially and have a high caring load. These factors were systematically related to lower well-being. A uniformly negative appraisal of caring for people with intellectual disability was not supported by these English population-representative data. Poverty and long caregiving hours may make caregivers more susceptible to negative wellbeing. Support for caregivers of people with intellectual disability should focus on alleviating those two factors.

Title:  computer-aided design  
Abstract: This paper proposes a protection method for single line-to-ground (SLG) faults in an ungrounded offshore wind farm with fully-rated converter-based wind turbines. The proposed method uses the unsynchronized current phasors measured by unit protections installed at the connection point of the fully-rated converter (FRC)-based wind turbines (WTs). Each unit protection collects the unsynchronized current phasors from two adjacent nodes and synchronizes them by aligning the positive-sequence current to the same phase angle. The faulted section is identified by comparing the phase angles of the synchronized zero-sequence currents from adjacent nodes. Simulations of an ungrounded offshore wind farm with relay models were carried out using power system computer-aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including direct current (EMTDC).

Title:  Fungal Infection  
Abstract: Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungal pathogen and the primary causative species of invasive aspergillosis, a systemic disease associated with high mortality rates. Treatment of invasive fungal infection relies on a very limited number of antifungal drug classes. In order to extend the spectrum of antifungal drugs novel target structures have to be identified. The ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES), a recently discovered tether that links mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, is a potential drug target based on its absence in Metazoa. Very recently, it was shown that ERMES is important for the fitness and immune evasion of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. We studied the role of the four ERMES core components Mdm10, Mdm12, Mdm34 and Mmm1 in the pathogenic mold A. fumigatus. By construction and characterizing conditional mutants of all four core components and deletion mutants of mdm10 and mdm12, we show that each component is of significant importance for growth of the fungal pathogen. While markedness of the individual mutant phenotypes differed slightly, all components are important for maintenance of the mitochondrial morphology and the intra-organellar distribution of nucleoids. Characterization of the Mmml ERMES mutant in a Galleria mellonella infection model indicates that ERMES contributes to virulence of A. fumigatus. Our results demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of ERMES could exert antifungal activity against this important pathogen. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Title:  Computer graphics  
Abstract: The structural design paradigm has evolved from an engineering-oriented approach to a holistic one that accommodates various concerns including form, function, behavior, economy, efficiency, and elegance. Because as many aspects as possible must be considered in the early design stages to reduce downstream problems afterward, the design tool for this stage has to be iterative and interactive with designers to manipulate various alternatives. In addition, the advancement of computer graphics software together with generative algorithms provide rapid dynamic simulation that enables efficient interactive design. This research has focused on rapid prototyping for the development of a computer-supported design tool that helps to perform the conceptual design of suspension bridges from the designer's concept to computer simulation during the conceptual design stage. The design information and tasks in conceptual design are formalized in terms of entities using the concept of an entity-based model, and these entities are further implemented into the generative algorithms of graphic software. Thanks to the dynamic simulation of the implemented design tool, conceptual design can be done interactively and iteratively while generating and selecting design alternatives following a graphical approach.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: The China development model
Abstract: Over the last thirty years, China has been reforming its economy at breakneck speed. In China, as in every country, the time of reformation is a crucial one. Although China's growth model is likely to be very effective in coping with today's economic requirements, the reform policy implemented by China's leaders is facing increased opposition from both within the Party as well as from society as a whole. A surge in nationalism is threatening China's relations with its neighbours and its rise to regional leadership. In the aftermath of the worldwide financial crisis, China has emerged as the second largest economy soon to overtake the USA, but the crisis has also emphasized the reliance of China's economy on the developed market and the subsequent decreasing growth rate. The Chinese growth model is now reaching to the core of the system i.e. the social and political institutions. This book addresses a wide range of factors influencing the development of China's model and its influence on the rest of the world. --

Title: Choosing not to choose
Abstract: Our ability to make choices is fundamental to our sense of ourselves as human beings, and essential to the political values of freedom-protecting nations. Whom we love; where we work; how we spend our time; what we buy; such choices define us in the eyes of ourselves and others, and much blood and ink has been spilt to establish and protect our rights to make them freely. Choice can also be a burden. Our cognitive capacity to research and make the best decisions is limited, so every active choice comes at a cost. In modern life the requirement to make active choices can often be overwhelming. So, across broad areas of our lives, from health plans to energy suppliers, many of us choose not to choose. By following our default options, we save ourselves the costs of making active choices. By setting those options, governments and corporations dictate the outcomes for when we decide by default. This is among the most significant ways in which they effect social change, yet we are just beginning to understand the power and impact of default rules. Many central questions remain unanswered: When should governments set such defaults, and when should they insist on active choices? How should such defaults be made? What makes some defaults successful while others fail? Cass R. Sunstein has long been at the forefront of developing public policy and regulation to use government power to encourage people to make better decisions. In this major new book, Choosing Not to Choose, he presents his most complete argument yet for how we should understand the value of choice, and when and how we should enable people to choose not to choose. The onset of big data gives corporations and governments the power to make ever more sophisticated decisions on our behalf, defaulting us to buy the goods we predictably want, or vote for the parties and policies we predictably support. As consumers we are starting to embrace the benefits this can bring. But should we? What will be the long-term effects of limiting our active choices on our agency? And can such personalized defaults be imported from the marketplace to politics and the law? Confronting the challenging future of data-driven decision-making, Sunstein presents a manifesto for how personalized defaults should be used to enhance, rather than restrict, our freedom and well-being--

Title: Choosing schools
Abstract: The authors analyze what parents value in education, how much they know about schools, how well they can match what they say they want in schools with what their children get, how satisfied they are with their children's schools, and how their involvement in the schools is affected by the opportunity to choose. They discover, most notably, that low-income parents value education as much as, if not more than, high-income parents, but do not have access to the same quality of school information. This problem comes under sensitive, thorough scrutiny as do a host of other important topics, from school performance to segregation to children at risk of being left behind.--BOOK JACKET.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Skin Care  
Abstract: Background: Skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant, commonly referred to as Kangaroo Care (KC), has demonstrated efficacy as a pain-relieving strategy for infants, yet, it remains underutilized in clinical practice. Purpose: To evaluate changes in neonatal intensive care unit staff nurse beliefs, utilization, and challenges related to practice change in implementing KC as an intervention for management of procedural pain in preterm infants between 2 time points. Methods: Nurses who participated in a larger clinical trial examining the sustained efficacy of KC were asked to complete a questionnaire at 2 time points: 1-and 6 month(s) following study initiation. Identified benefits, expectations, frequency of use, and challenges related to practice change uptake were described using frequencies and percentages. Data from the 2 different time points were compared using. 2 analysis. Results: Of the 40 nurses approached, all completed the questionnaire (19 at the 1-month and 21 at the 6-month time point). Of the sample (n = 40), 97% of participants indicated that they expected KC to provide good pain relief or better. Staff nurses reported significantly improved preconceived ideas (chi(2) = 22.68, P <.01) and significantly fewer concerns (chi(2) = 22.10, P =.01) related to using KC as a pain-relieving intervention between the 2 time points. No significant differences were seen in the frequency of using KC as an intervention between time points. Implications for Research and Practice: Despite increasingly positive preconceived ideas and reduced concerns, the frequency of using KC for procedural pain relief remained unchanged. Further research addressing ways to overcome barriers to utilizing KC as an intervention for procedural pain is warranted.

Title: Handbook for academic authors 
Abstract: When our work is accepted, we share our happiness with colleagues. When it is rejected, we keep our disappointment to ourselves. That very natural response unfortunately makes an author receiving that first rejection believe (despite the statistics on acceptance rates) that this has never happened to anyone else. At some point, something you write will be rejected by a journal or book publisher. To lessen the trauma, I'm going to tell you the story of this book - now in its sixth edition, with thousands of copies sold around the world. The story begins with a rejection letter. In 1985 I completed a manuscript that I titled A Handbook for Academic Authors and asked a colleague to read it for me. I knew he was an excellent critical reader, though totally tactless. I revised to respond to his many comments and sent the manuscript to University Press A, which I thought was an obvious fit. They rejected it almost immediately, with what I suspect was a form letter. I was irritated, but because it clearly hadn't gone to outside readers I felt the rejection had nothing to do with the quality of my work. The next day I sent query letters and sample chapters to twelve publishers: six university presses, and six commercial publishers of quality nonfiction. Soon two more rejection letters arrived on a single day: a university press editor informed me that it was an excellent idea but more suitable for a trade publisher; a trade editor said it was an excellent idea but belonged at a university press. Two more form rejections followed--

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Weight Loss  
Abstract: Objective: Disease-related weight loss is relatively common in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), but limited data exist regarding the effects of nutritional status on survival. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between malnutrition (as measured by Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment [PG-SGA]) and clinical characteristics of patients with MM, and to investigate the association between the PG-SGA score before chemotherapy and overall survival in MM patients. Methods: Using the PG-SGA score, we retrospectively explored the effect of malnutrition on the survival of Asian patients with MM. Results: We divided 216 patients with MM into three groups based on their PG-SGA scores. Of these patients 23% (n = 50) had PG-SGA scores >= 9, indicating severe malnutrition requiring specialist nutrition intervention. Body mass index and serum hemoglobin were independently associated with PG-SGA scores (P= 9 (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that PG-SGA scores >= 9 compared with PG-SGA scores of 0 to 3 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.347; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.271-4.334; P = 0.006), International Staging System (155) stage III compared with ISS stage I (HR, 2360; 95% CI, 1.271-4.379; P = 0.007), and autologous stem cell transplantation (HR, 0388; 95% CI, 0.248-0.606; P < 0.001) were associated with overall survival. Conclusions: A higher PG-SGA score before chemotherapy was associated with reduced survival among patients with MM. Nutritional evaluation should be an integral part of the clinical assessment of MM patients, and the PG-SGA score would be an appropriate tool to evaluate nutritional status. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title:  Computer graphics  
Abstract: This paper poses the problem of fabricating physical construction sets from example geometry: A construction set provides a small number of different types of building blocks from which the example model as well as many similar variants can be reassembled. This process is formalized by tiling grammars. Our core contribution is an approach for simplifying tiling grammars such that we obtain physically manufacturable building blocks of controllable granularity while retaining variability, i.e., the ability to construct many different, related shapes. Simplification is performed by sequences of two types of elementary Operations: non-local joint edge collapses in the tile graphs reduce the granularity of the decomposition and approximate replacement Operations reduce redundancy. We evaluate our method on abstract graph grammars in addition to computing several physical construction sets, which are manufactured using a commodity 3D printer.

Title:  Bipolar Disorder  
Abstract: Splitting of the behavioural activity phase has been found in nocturnal rodents with suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) coupling disorder. A similar phenomenon was observed in the sleep phase in the diurnal human discussed here, suggesting that there are so-called evening and morning oscillators in the SCN of humans. The present case suffered from bipolar disorder refractory to various treatments, and various circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as delayed sleep phase, polyphasic sleep, separation of the sleep bout resembling splitting and circabidian rhythm (48 h), were found during prolonged depressive episodes with hypersomnia. Separation of sleep into evening and morning components and delayed sleep-offset (24.69-h cycle) developed when lowering and stopping the dose of aripiprazole (APZ). However, resumption of APZ improved these symptoms in 2 weeks, accompanied by improvement in the patient's depressive state. Administration of APZ may improve various circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as well as improve and prevent manic-depressive episodes, via augmentation of coupling in the SCN network.

Abstract: Background: Computed tomography (CT) examinations of the lumbar spine are commonly performed in patients aged <= 40 years due to low back pain (LBP). Purpose: To investigate the prevalence and awareness of radiologists for the presence of structural post-inflammatory/other sacroiliac joint (SIJ) alterations on lumbar spine CTs of young patients with LBP. Material and Methods: A total of 484 lumbar spine CTexaminations (272 men, 212 women; average age, 31 years; age range, 18-40 years) of patients with LBP in which the entire SIJs were visualized were retrospectively reviewed. SIJs were scored (consensus) by two senior radiologists (study reading) for the presence of post-inflammatory structural SIJ findings or other SIJs alterations. The original reports were compared to the study reading. Fifty CT examinations were re-evaluated for reliability assessment (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC]). Results: A total of 150 (31%) abnormal SIJ examinations were registered (ICC: r = 0.7-0.8; P < 0.0001): suspected sacroiliitis = 50 (10.2%); definite sacroiliitis = 16 (3.3%); osteitis-condensans-ilii = 38 (7.8%); diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis = 24 (5%); degenerative changes = 22 (4.5%); accessory SIJ = 22 (4.5%); and tumor = 1. The SIJs were referenced 39 times (8.0%) in the original readings: pathological findings (n = 15); and normal SIJ (n = 24). Total diagnostic accuracy for these reports only and for the entire readings were 49% and 69%, respectively, and 13% and 1.3%, respectively, for the pathological findings. Conclusion: Sacroiliitis and other SIJ alterations are prevalent in young individuals with LBP, albeit, the majority of these alterations are not recognized nor reported by senior radiologists thus may delay efficacious treatment.

Title: The Routledge handbook of translation studies and linguistics 
Abstract: The first part begins by addressing the relationships between translation studies and linguistics as major topics of study in themselves before focusing, in individual chapters, on the relationships between translation on the one hand and semantics, semiotics and the sound system of language on the other. Part II explores the nature of meaning and the ways in which meaning can be shared in text pairs that are related to each other as first-written texts and their translations, while Part III focuses on the relationships between translation and interpreting and the written and spoken word. Part IV considers the users of language and situations involving more than one language and Part V addresses technological tools that can assist language users. Finally, Part VI presents chapters on the links between areas of applied linguistics and translation and interpreting.

Title:  Molecular biology  
Abstract: Malaria is the most devastating parasitic disease of humans, caused by the unicellular protozoa of the Plasmodium genus, such as Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and is responsible for up to a million deaths each year. Pf life cycle is complex, with transmission of the parasite between humans via mosquitos involving a remarkable series of morphological transformations. In the bloodstream, the parasites undergo asexual multiplications inside the red blood cell (RBC), where they mature through the ring (R), trophozoite (T) and schizont (S) stages, and sexual development, resulting in gametocytes (G). All symptoms of malaria pathology are caused by the asexual blood stage parasites. Flow cytometry methods were previously used to detect malaria infected (i) RBCs, in live or fixed cells, using DNA (Hoechst) and RNA (Thiazole Orange) stains. Here, by using imaging flow cytometry, we developed improved methods of identifying and quantifying each of the four parasite blood stages (R, T, S and G). This technique allows multi-channel, high resolution imaging of individual parasites, as well as detailed morphological quantification of Pf-iRBCs cultures. Moreover, by measuring iRBC morphological properties, we can eliminate corrupted and extra cellular (dying) parasites from the analysis, providing accurate quantification and robust measurement of the parasitemia profile. This new method is a valuable tool in malaria molecular biology research and drug screen assays. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Osteoporosis  
Abstract: Background: Poor adherence with oral bisphosphonates (BPs) can mitigate their therapeutic benefit for osteoporosis and is a significant clinical burden. Most previous studies regarding adherence with oral BPs have focused on postmenopausal osteoporosis, but little attention has been given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Thus, we investigated compliance and persistence with oral BPs in the treatment of osteoporosis and analyzed risk factors for poor adherence in female patients with (RA) in real setting. Methods: This is a retrospective longitudinal study including 396 female patients with RA in whom oral BPs were newly initiated from Aug 2004 to Aug 2014 at a university rheumatology center in South Korea. Compliance was quantified using the 1-year medication possession ratio (MPR), while persistence was defined as duration from the initiation to the end of BPs therapy without interruption exceeding 56 days. Seropositve RA was defined as having a positive test result for the presence of either rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody. Results: Of 396 RA patients, 221 (55.8%) were prescribed risedronate 35 mg weekly; 17 (4.3%) received alendronate 70 mg weekly; and 158 (39.9%) received ibandronate 150 mg monthly. The 1-year MPR was 70.1% and the proportion of RA patients with the 1-year MPR = 0.8 was 60.1%. A total of 274 (69.2%) patients discontinued oral BPs during the study period and persistence with BPs was 63.3% at 1 year, 50.7% at 2 years and 33.3% at 3 years. The most common cause of non-persistence was adverse events (47.5%), followed by poor health literacy (40.5%) and cost (12%). Both compliance and persistence with monthly oral BPs were significantly lower than those with weekly regimens (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.59-3. 89, P < 0.001 and HR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.69-2.83, P < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, patients with seropositive RA showed better compliance and persistence with BPs compared with their seronegative counterparts. Conclusions: Compliance and persistence with oral BPs in RA patients were suboptimal in real practice, thereby limiting the efficacy of osteoporosis treatment. Extending the dosing interval of BPs may improve medication adherence in RA patients.

Title:  Electricity  
Abstract: In this paper, a hypothetical district representing the typical urban districts in Hong Kong was considered and a district cooling system model was designed for this district. Mathematical models were tailor-designed for all the major district cooling system equipment to simulate the effects of changing the pumping station's configuration on the energy performance of the district cooling system. The measures included the use of multiple pumping stations and an unequal number of pumps in each station. In view of the vast number of pumping station combinations possible for analysis, a hydraulic gradient evaluation method was adopted to assist a quick assessment and exploration of those combinations that would be technically feasible. Furthermore, the energy performance of all these technically feasible combinations was evaluated to identify an optimum design that would lead to the lowest electricity consumption. Practical application: In a district cooling system where there is only one main pumping station for distributing chilled water to all the buildings in the district, the chilled water flow rate and pressure head are very high. Adding booster pumping stations can help to reduce pressure head, pump size and hence power demand of the main pumping station. In this paper, the effects of different pumping station configurations on the energy performance of a district cooling system were investigated. The configuration that could mitigate the impacts of a low delta-T on the energy performance of the district cooling system was also identified.

Title:  Atopic Dermatitis  
Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a biphasic inflammatory skin disease that is provoked by epidermal barrier defects, immune dysregulation, and increased skin infections. Previously, we have demonstrated that bvPLA2 evoked immune tolerance by inducing regulatory T cells (Treg), and thus alleviated Th2 dominant allergic asthma in mice. Here, we would like to determine whether treatment with bvPLA2 exacerbates the AD-like allergic inflammations induced by house dust mite extract (DFE) in a murine model. Epidermal thickness, immune cell infiltration, serum immunoglobulin, and cytokines were measured. Ear swelling, skin lesions, and the levels of total serum IgE and Th1/Th2 cytokines were elevated in DFE/DNCB-induced AD mice. Topical application of bvPLA2 elicited significant suppression of the increased AD symptoms, including ear thickness, serum IgE concentration, inflammatory cytokines, and histological changes. Furthermore, bvPLA2 treatment inhibited mast cell infiltration into the ear. On the other hand, Treg cell depletion abolished the anti-atopic effects of bvPLA2, suggesting that the effects of bvPLA2 depend on the existence of Tregs. Taken together, the results revealed that topical exposure to bvPLA2 aggravated atopic skin inflammation, suggesting that bvPLA2 might be a candidate for the treatment of AD.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

Title: Honours versus money
Abstract: Honours fulfil one of the most fundamental desires of human beings, namely, to be recognised and held in esteem by others. There are thousands of awards in all areas of society: the state, arts and media, sports, religion, the voluntary sector, academia, and business. Awards are well visible, can raise the recipients' intrinsic motivation and creativity, and establish a bond of loyalty to the giver. They have distinct advantages over money and other rewards. 0Presenting empirical evidence using modern statistical techniques 'Honours versus Money' argues that awards can significantly raise performance in different contexts even if they are purely symbolic, recommending how this can be used in practice. It makes the case for reorienting our focus- away from the monetary or material dimensions of work and private life, and towards the symbolic dimensions to celebrate and shine a light on merit and achievement. 0'Honours versus Money' discusses award bestowals in their different forms and facets, including as signals and as components of organisations' human resource strategies. It opens our perspective for motivational strategies beyond money, while also outlining their potential pitfalls.

Title:  Bioinformatics  
Abstract: As muscle activity during growth is considerably important for mandible quality and morphology, reducing dietary loading directly influences the development and metabolic activity of mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC). However, an overall investigation of changes in the protein composition of MCC has not been fully described in literature. To study the protein expression and putative signaling in vivo, we evaluated the structural changes of MCC and differentially expressed proteins induced by reducing functional loading in rat MCC at developmental stages. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation-based 2D nano-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) technologies were used. Global protein profiling, KEGG and PANTHER pathways, and functional categories were analyzed. Consequently, histological and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining indicated the altered histological structure of condylar cartilage and increased bone remodeling activity in hard-diet group. A total of 805 differentially expressed proteins were then identified. GO analysis revealed a significant number of proteins involved in the metabolic process, cellular process, biological regulation, localization, developmental process, and response to stimulus. KEGG pathway analysis also suggested that these proteins participated in various signaling pathways, including calcium signaling pathway, gap junction, ErbB signaling pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Collagen types I and II were further validated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. Taken together, the present study provides an insight into the molecular mechanism of regulating condylar growth and remodeling induced by reducing dietary loading at the protein level.

Title:  HIV/AIDS  
Abstract: Background: Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) are legally sanctioned environments for people to inject drugs under medical supervision. SIFs currently operate in ten countries, but to date, no SIF has been opened in the USA. In light of increasing overdose mortality in the USA, this study evaluated willingness to use a SIF among youth who report non-medical prescription opioid (NMPO) use. Methods: Between January 2015 and February 2016, youth with recent NMPO use were recruited to participate in the Rhode Island Young Adult Prescription Drug Study (RAPiDS). We explored factors associated with willingness to use a SIF among participants who had injected drugs or were at risk of initiating injection drug use (defined as having a sex partner who injects drugs or having a close friend who injects). Results: Among 54 eligible participants, the median age was 26 (IQR = 24-28), 70.4% were male, and 74.1% were white. Among all participants, when asked if they would use a SIF, 63.0% answered ""Yes"", 31.5% answered ""No"", and 5. 6% were unsure. Among the 31 participants reporting injection drug use in the last six months, 27 (87.1%) reported willingness to use a SIF; 15 of the 19 (78.9%) who injected less than daily reported willingness, while all 12 (100.0%) of the participants who injected daily reported willingness. Compared to participants who were unwilling or were unsure, participants willing to use a SIF were also more likely to have been homeless in the last six months, have accidentally overdosed, have used heroin, have used fentanyl non-medically, and typically use prescription opioids alone. Conclusions: Among young adults who use prescription opioids non-medically and inject drugs or are at risk of initiating injection drug use, more than six in ten reported willingness to use a SIF. Established risk factors for overdose, including homelessness, history of overdose, daily injection drug use, heroin use, and fentanyl misuse, were associated with higher SIF acceptability, indicating that young people at the highest risk of overdose might ultimately be the same individuals to use the facility. Supervised injection facilities merit consideration to reduce overdose mortality in the USA.

Title: Constructing China
Abstract: Goebel studies four representative works by Kafka that explore the problems of the Western representation of the Orient: his 'Description of a Struggle'; several letters to Felice Bauer, offering an interpretation of Chinese poetry in connection with the conflict between writing and Kafka's love for Felice; the canonical story 'The Great Wall of China', parodically appropriating sterotypes of China's stagnant history and authoritarian emperors for a refutation of colonialist ideas of progress; and the sequel 'An Old Manuscript', dramatising China's invasion by foreign powers and the breakdown of crosscultural communication. Elucidating these themes from a broadly comparative perspective, Goebel shows Kafka to be one of German modernism's most intriguing and self-reflective writers on the Orient.

Title: How to speak machine
Abstract: John Maeda is one of the world's preeminent interdisciplinary thinkers on technology and design. In How to Speak Machine, he offers a set of simple laws that govern not only the computers of today, but the unimaginable machines of the future. Technology is already more powerful than we can comprehend, and getting more powerful at an exponential pace. Once set in motion, algorithms never tire. And when a program's size, speed, and tirelessness combine with its ability to learn and transform itself, the outcome can be unpredictable and dangerous. Take the seemingly instant transformation of Microsoft's chatbot Tay into a hate-spewing racist, or how crime-predicting algorithms reinforce racial bias. How to Speak Machine provides a coherent framework for today's product designers, business leaders, and policymakers to grasp this brave new world. Drawing on his wide-ranging experience from engineering to computer science to design, Maeda shows how businesses and individuals can identify opportunities afforded by technology to make world-changing and inclusive products--while avoiding the pitfalls inherent to the medium--

Title:  Parkinson's Disease  
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have explored the effect of asymmetric lipids specifically those that contain one polyunsaturated (PUFA) and one saturated fatty acid chain on phase separation in heterogeneous membranes. These lipids are prevalent in neuronal membranes, particularly in synaptic membranes, where the Parkinson's Disease protein a-Synuclein (alpha S) is found. We have therefore explored the relationship between asymmetric, PUFA-containing lipids, and aS. The simulations show that asymmetric lipids partition to the liquid disordered (Ld) phase of canonical raft mixtures because of the highly disordered PUFA chain. In the case of a membrane built to mimic the lipid composition of a synaptic vesicle, the PUFA-containing asymmetric lipids completely disrupt phase separation. Because aS is positively charged, we show that it partitions with negatively charged lipids, regardless of the saturation state of the chains. Additionally, aS preferentially associates with the polyunsaturated fatty add tails of both charged and neutral lipids. This is a consequence of those chains' ability to accommodate the void beneath the amphipathic helix.

Title: The Democratic Foundations of policy diffusion
Abstract: Why do law reforms spread around the world in waves? Leading theories argue that international networks of technocratic elites develop orthodox solutions that they singlehandedly transplant across countries. But, in modern democracies, elites alone cannot press for legislative reforms without winning the support of politicians, voters, and interest groups. As Katerina Linos shows in The Democratic Foundations of Policy Diffusion, international models can help politicians generate domestic enthusiasm for far-reaching proposals. By pointing to models from abroad, policitians can persuade voters that their ideas are not radical, ill-thought out experiments, but mainstream, tried-and-true solutions. The more familiar voters are with a certain country or an international organization, the more willing they are to support policies adopted in that country or recommended by that organization.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: The rise to market leadership
Abstract: In recent years many new international market leaders from the BRICS countries have emerged in diverse manufacturing and service industries. How did these new leaders emerge and become key players in their respective industries? What factors contributed to their success and enabled them to become market leaders? This new study answers these important questions with evidence presented from case studies in the automotive, pharmaceutical and ICT industries of China, India and Brazil. A common framework of analysis is followed throughout the volume allowing readers to compare and contrast the cases examined. This framework brings together factors at the firm, country and sectoral levels to explain the rise to leadership of these firms. The book highlights the importance of vibrant entrepreneurship and demonstrates that being local and having an ability to learn and build capabilities based on local knowledge have been major drivers of market success. Yet it also shows how such firm-level factors have been complemented by the role of both national and sectoral systems of innovation. This book offers an integrated framework for the study of innovation and the rise of market leaders as well as original case studies from important emerging economies.

Title: The power of line
Abstract: There are no lines in nature--they are always the creation of humans, manifestations of human action, perception, and design. Lines can divide or connect, may be static or full of movement, and represent and create forms in space and time. And in many cultures, lines take center stage in science, art, writing, drawing, and construction. Employing a vast array of academic perspectives, this fascinating collection delves into the phenomenon of the line, as well as the power it holds for us. From the history of art and science to philosophy, the essays in The Power of Line elucidate the semantic and conceptual depth of the line in European, Asian, and Islamic cultures. As they trace the continuity and transformation of the line over the course of centuries, the authors not only reveal it to be a constitutive element in architecture, art, and writing, but also uncover its importance as a medium of expression in both choreography and the scientific and technological fields. With copious full-color images, The Power of Line is a captivating exploration of the line as an essential artistic and cultural means of expression.

Title:  Software engineering  
Abstract: The International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) maintains a repository of data about completed software projects. A common use of the ISBSG dataset is to investigate models to estimate a software project's size, effort, duration, and cost. The aim of this paper is to determine which and to what extent variables in the ISBSG dataset have been used in software engineering to build effort estimation models. For that purpose a systematic mapping study was applied to 107 research papers, obtained after a filtering process, that were published from 2000 until the end of 2013, and which listed the independent variables used in the effort estimation models. The usage of ISBSG variables for filtering, as dependent variables, and as independent variables is described. The 20 variables (out of 71) mostly used as independent variables for effort estimation are identified and analysed in detail, with reference to the papers and types of estimation methods that used them. We propose guidelines that can help researchers make informed decisions about which ISBSG variables to select for their effort estimation models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Green Building  
Abstract: At the UN-Paris conference in 2015 countries accepted the challenge to fight Green House Gas emissions (GHG) during the next decades in an attempt to stop global warming. In Europe the aim is that all future new buildings aim at nearly zero-energy consumption and be highly material efficient whilst the existing building stock will be refurbished at a rate of 2% annually. Numerous international scientific studies have found that timber-framed buildings result in lower GHG emissions than their steel and concrete counterparts. For green building construction (relative) new timber products and connection methods conquer the market such as Cross Laminated Timber products. CLT products allow fast and cost effective execution of the building while structural limitations and disadvantages of the traditional timber frame construction are overcome. Examples of multi-storey timber structures are presented. These steps forward were ministered by the development of innovative timber fastener connections like self-tapping screws and reinforced dvw tube connections. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Title:  Electrical network  
Abstract: This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of a hybrid system powering a school in Misurata, Libya. Potential of renewable power system for school is evaluated. HOMER optimization model is used to evaluate the different possible configuration options for supplying the electrical load. Daily typical energy consumption profiles the four seasons, design based on a medium size school. Spring, summer and autumn weather conditions are not as extreme as winter, this decreases the load demand during these seasons. Winter weather conditions are used as the basis where peak energy demand is expected because lighting and heating loads dominate in the climate of Libya. Winter electrical load is found to be the maximum load. HOMER software tool was used to determine the optimum size and specifications of renewable power system. When Solar radiation and wind speed are at their maximum values of (7 kWh/m(2)/d, 5.50 m/s) and the fuel price is assumed as a minimum (0.10US$), the most feasible power system economically is (PV/Tur/Gen/Battery) with total net present cost (NPC) of 293961US$, cost of energy (COE) of US$ 0.191/kWh, and renewable fraction (RF) of 53%. When solar radiation, wind speed and fuel price are assumed at average values of (5.05 kWh/m(2)/d, 4.84 m/s, and 0.40US$) the optimal solution is also (PV/Tur/Gen/Battery) with (NPC) of 384181US$ and (COE) of US$ 0.25/kWh, and (RF) of 79%. When the solar radiation and wind speed are presumed at minimum values of (3 kWh/m(2)/d, 3.50 m/s) and the fuel price is assumed maximum (1.25US$), the most feasible economical system is still (PV/Tur/Gen/Battery) with (NPC) of 753505US$ and (COE) of US$ 0.489/kWh, and (RF) of 71%. The excess electricity from the hybrid power system during spring, summer and autumn can be sold to the utility (General Electrical Network) or used for other applications. This will enhance the economical feasibility of hybrid power systems in schools. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title: Design solutions for urban densification 
Abstract: The world's metropolises are home to steadily growing populations. Densification measures are one solution to the problems of urbanization, creating inner-city living space where there was none before. The smallest of gaps between buildings is utilized, perimeter block developments are completed, courtyards filled in, houses heightened and smaller structures replaced with larger ones. This process of densification preserves existing and naturally developed quarters and infrastructure, while protecting against urban sprawl and the development of soulless quarters full of new builds. In some cases, a self-contained element that clearly sets itself apart from the existing built environment is most suitable; in others, the best solution is the re-interpretation and development of the existing context. The architectural approach to each project is as unique as its context.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Low Testosterone  
Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the sociodemographic parameters and hormonal profile of infertile man. Patients and methods: We included in our study, all patients presenting with infertility dating back at least two years, with abnormal semen analysis. These patients came to radio immunological laboratory assays for determination of FSH, LH, PRL and testosterone in the assessment of infertility. Results: The age of the patients ranged from 25 years to 64 years with an average age of 44.5 years. Employees are the most represented with a frequency of 63.93%, with 54.41% had consulted a primary infertility, followed by traders in 15.63% and 70% for primary infertility. The hormonal assessment was abnormal in 86% of cases (55/64). A rise in FSH was observed in 36% of patients, the LH was elevated in 31.25% of patients, 48.44% in PRL. 12 patients (18.75%) had low testosterone Among the endocrinopathies suspected, the hypogonadism hypergonadotrophic is the most represented with a frequency of 32.8%, testicular deficiencies are found in 12.5% of cases, hypogonadism hypogonadotrophic in 10.93% of cases, hyperprolactinemia isolated in 18.75% of cases and obstructive causes in 14 04% of cases. Conclusion: There are many endocrinopathies that can induce male infertility. They can be congenital or acquired and can concern several stages, hypothalamus, pituitary and testis. It's important to diagnose thoses endocrinopathies, because some of them are accessible to treatment. (C) 2016 Pan Africau Urological Surgeons' Association. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Title:  Molecular biology  
Abstract: The symbiotic interaction between legume plants and rhizobia results in the formation of root nodules, in which symbiotic plant cells host and harbor thousands of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. Here, a Medicago truncatula nodules with activated defense 1 (nad1) mutant was identified using reverse genetics methods. The mutant phenotype was characterized using cell and molecular biology approaches. An RNA-sequencing technique was used to analyze the transcriptomic reprogramming of nad1 mutant nodules. In the nad1 mutant plants, rhizobial infection and propagation in infection threads are normal, whereas rhizobia and their symbiotic plant cells become necrotic immediately after rhizobia are released from infection threads into symbiotic cells of nodules. Defense-associated responses were detected in nad1 nodules. NAD1 is specifically present in root nodule symbiosis plants with the exception of Morus notabilis, and the transcript is highly induced in nodules. NAD1 encodes a small uncharacterized protein with two predicted transmembrane helices and is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Our data demonstrate a positive role for NAD1 in the maintenance of rhizobial endosymbiosis during nodulation.

Your task is to classify the given Title and Abstract into the MOST appropriate categories from the allowed list.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY):
You must perform DEFINITION-DRIVEN classification.
All decisions MUST be based ONLY on semantic alignment between the text and the provided category descriptions.
Do NOT rely on prior knowledge, topic popularity, typical venues, or common classifications.
Do NOT infer missing details.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Networked governance and transatlantic relations
Abstract: In today's complex and interconnected world, scholars of international relations seek to better understand challenges spurred by intensified global communication and interaction. The complex connectedness of modern society and politics compels us to investigate the pattern of interconnections among actors who inhabit social and political spaces. Gabriella Paar-Jakli's study aims to advance theory and practice by examining the networks used by specialists in North America and Europe to achieve their policy goals in the area of science and technology. Her book suggests that to overcome policy problems transnationally, three critical factors should be considered. First, as science and technology policy becomes increasingly critical to resolving global issues, it should be regarded as an integral element of the foreign policy process. Second, as liberal international relations theory argues, the increasing role of NGOs must be taken seriously alongside states as vital agents of policy reform. Third, as transatlantic relations remain center to maintaining the global order, they must be reconsidered. Paar-Jakli assesses the role of digital networks as facilitators of regional cooperation. Utilizing various techniques of social network analysis, her research indicates an active and structurally discernible network in cyberspace among transatlantic organizations, and demonstrates the role of virtual networks as facilitators of cooperative arrangements in transatlantic relations. Paar-Jakli's original research uses social network analysis to investigate transatlantic cooperation, a new approach that will be noteworthy to network and transatlantic scholars as well as policymakers--

Title:  Stress Management  
Abstract: Purpose: Emergency department (ED) nurses suffer from persistent stress after experiencing the traumatic event of exposure to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which can subsequently lead to burnout. This study aimed to assess ED nurses' burnout level during an outbreak of MERS-CoV and to identify influencing factors in order to provide basic information for lowering and preventing the level of burnout. Methods: Study participants were ED nurses working in eight hospitals designated for treating MERSCoV-infected patients in Korea. We performed multiple regression analysis to explore the factors influencing burnout. Results: The ED nurses' burnout was affected by job stress (beta = 0.59, p < .001), poor hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV (beta = -0.19, p < .001) and poor support from family and friends (beta = 0.14, p < .05). These three variables explained 47.3% of the variance in burnout. Conclusions: ED nurses taking care of MERS-CoV-infected patients should be aware that burnout is higher for nurses in their divisions than nurses in other hospital departments and that job stress is the biggest influential factor of burnout. To be ready for the outbreak of emerging contagious diseases such as MERS-CoV, efforts and preparations should be made to reduce burnout. Job stress should be managed and resolved. Working conditions for mitigating job stress and systematic stress management programs should be provided, and hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV need to be reinforced. Moreover, promoting support from family and friends is required. Copyright (C) 2016, Korean Society of Nursing Science. Published by Elsevier.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: The new economics of inequality and redistribution 
Abstract: Economists warn that policies to level the economic playing field come with a hefty price tag. But this so-called 'equality-efficiency trade-off' - has proven difficult to document. The data suggest, instead, that the extraordinary levels of economic inequality now experienced in many economies are detrimental to the economy. Moreover, recent economic experiments and other evidence confirm that most citizens are committed to fairness and are willing to sacrifice to help those less fortunate than themselves. Incorporating the latest results from behavioral economics and the new microeconomics of credit and labor markets, Bowles shows that escalating economic disparity is not the unavoidable price of progress. Rather it is policy choice - often a very costly one. Here drawing on his experience both as a policy advisor and an academic economist, Samuel Bowles offers an alternative direction, a novel and optimistic account of a more just and better working economy--

Title: The language of Jane Austen 
Abstract: Joe Bray's careful analysis of Jane Austen's stylistic techniques reveals that the genius of her writing is far from effortless; rather he makes the case for her as a meticulous craftswoman and a radical stylistic pioneer. Countering those who have detected in her novels a dominant, authoritative perspective, Bray begins by highlighting the complex, ever-shifting and ambiguous nature of the point of view through which her narratives are presented. This argument is then advanced through an exploration of the subtle representation of speech, thought and writing in Austen's novels. Subsequent chapters investigate and challenge the common critical associations of Austen's style with moral prescriptivism, ideas of balance and harmony, and literal as opposed to figurative expression.

Title:  Data structures  
Abstract: We propose a two-step approach for the construction of planar smooth collision-free navigation paths. Obstacle avoidance techniques that rely on classical data structures are initially considered for the identification of piecewise linear paths having no intersection with the obstacles of a given scenario. Variations of the shortest piecewise linear path with angle-based criteria are proposed and discussed. In the second part of the scheme we rely on spline interpolation algorithms with tension parameters to provide a smooth planar control strategy. In particular, we consider the class of curves with Pythagorean structures, because they provide an exact computation of fundamental geometric quantities. A selection of test cases demonstrates the quality of the new motion planning scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Body and voice
Abstract: Body and Voice: Somatic Re-education is an excellent resource for teachers of singing, voice coaches, and speech-language pathologists who work with singers and other voice professionals. It provides a new paradigm for working with singers in a way that allows for improved kinesthetic awareness needed to work with their body rather than against it. The text contains a series of lessons designed to train singing teachers, coaches, and voice therapists to recognize in their students the patterns of use and posture that interfere with respiration, phonation, andor resonance. In addition, it provides tools for the teacher to guide the student to a level of self-awareness of habituated patterns along with strategies to implement change from the inside out. Few pedagogical or therapeutic approaches provide any training in the recognition of the subtle, indirect patterns of use, stance, or tension that prevent students from relaxing the jaw, releasing the breath, lifting the palate, or any of the other demands teachers make to get them to sing well. Even when the teacher recognizes that there is a problem, the knowledge of how to retrain the student's neuro-musculo-skeletal system in order to effect real change and self-awareness by the student is often limited or lacking. Body and Voice: Somatic Re-education addresses this need. This book begins with a brief definition and theoretical overview of body reeducation, its principles and applications. Subsequent chapters teach how to recognize poor body dynamics. The final chapters provide specific lessons as well as guidance for independent explorations that will increase the student's kinesthetic and body awareness. A CD-ROM containing the lessons described in the book is included.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Days at the Morisaki bookshop
Abstract: Twenty-five-year-old Takako has enjoyed a relatively easy existence, until the day her boyfriend Hideaki, the man she expected to wed, casually announces he's been cheating on her and is marrying the other woman. Suddenly, Takako's life is in freefall. She loses her job, her friends, and her acquaintances, and spirals into a deep depression. In the depths of her despair, she receives a call from her distant uncle Satoru. An unusual man who has always pursued something of an unconventional life, especially after his wife Momoko left him out of the blue five years earlier, Satoru runs a second-hand bookshop in Jimbocho, Tokyo's famous book district. Takako once looked down upon Satoru's life. Now, she reluctantly accepts his offer of the tiny room above the bookshop rent-free in exchange for helping out at the store. The move is temporary, until she can get back on her feet. But in the months that follow, Takako surprises herself when she develops a passion for Japanese literature, becomes a regular at a local coffee shop where she makes new friends, and eventually meets a young editor from a nearby publishing house who's going through his own messy breakup. But just as she begins to find joy again, Hideaki reappears, forcing Takako to rely once again on her uncle, whose own life has begun to unravel. Together, these seeming opposites work to understand each other and themselves as they continue to share the wisdom they've gained in the bookshop.

Title: The cat from Hué
Abstract: This is the true story of a young American reporter who went to Vietnam with an open mind and an innocent heart and was plunged into a world of cruel beauty and savage violence. His experiences in the war forced him to question all his assumptions about his country, the nation's leaders and his own sanity. John Laurence covered Vietnam for CBS News from 1965 to 1970. He was judged by his colleagues to be the best television reporter of the war. He and his camera team lived with a squad of U.S. troops in the jungles of War Zone C to film The World of Charlie Company, a documentary that received every major award for broadcast journalism. Despite the professional acclaim, the traumatic stories Laurence covered became a personal burden that he carried long after the war was over. He struggled with memories of the Tet Offensive and the Battle of Hue, incoming artillery at Khe Sanh and Con Thien, the wounding of those around him, the deaths of his friends, the killing of civilians, a colonel who smoked opium during the siege of his camp, American troops who fell in love with their dead comrades. Mostly, his conscience haunted him about a close encounter with a North Vietnamese soldier that forced him to make a decision of life and death. After years of reckoning with his memories, Laurence has made sense of them in this memoir by weaving them into a compelling story. It is laced with humor, anger, love, and the unforgettable tale of a very idiosyncratic cat who was determined to play his part in the Vietnam revolution. In reconstructing his experiences, he has relied not only on his notes and memory, but also on hundreds of hours of film footage shot at the time. This gives the book an uncanny vividness and fidelity to facts.--BOOK JACKET.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Machine design  
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated system used for ultra-precision machine tool (UPMT) design in conceptual and fundamental design stage. This system is based on the dynamic, thermodynamic, and error budget theories. The candidate configurations of the machine tool are first selected from the configuration library or a novel configuration designed by the user, according to the functions of the machine tool expected to realize. Then, the appropriate configuration is given by comparing the stiffness chain, dynamic performance, thermal performance, and the error budget of each candidate configuration. Consequently, the integrated design system enables the conceptual and fundamental of the UPMT to be designed efficiently with a theoretical foundation. The proposed system was used for several UPMT designs, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated design system.

Title: Spiritual diversity in social work practice
Abstract: The first edition of this book (1999, Free Press) provided the first comprehensive framework of knowledge, values, and skills for addressing spiritual diversity in social work at a time when this topic was little known or accepted. The second edition (2010, Oxford University Press) was revised and expanded to reflect the significant growth of interest in spirituality within social work and other helping professions, in the USA and around the world. This third edition builds on that foundation and much expanded multidisciplinary and international work on the topic during the past eight years, including our own. In particular, this edition includes case examples and insights from a new third author, Hwi-Ja Canda, based on her 30 years of experience as a social work practitioner, in order to make the professional applications of our framework even more vivid and practical. The main new features of the third edition are: - Reorganization of content to enhance flow of ideas and guidelines for practice, including expansion of content on assessment and practice with two added chapters in Part III - Twice as many case examples and vignettes from personal and professional experiences, organized into 40 Scenarios throughout the book - Significantly expanded transdisciplinary literature review throughout the book - Increased integration of the strengths perspective throughout - Increase of international perspective, including analysis of worldwide professional codes of ethics - More exercises to engage the reader in personal and professional growth - Significant refinements of sections on human diversity, religious perspectives, and addition of 12 Steps perspective in Part II--

Title: Germany and the modern world, 1880-1914 
Abstract: The German Empire before 1914 had the fastest growing economy in Europe and was the strongest military power in the world. Yet it appeared, from a reading of many contemporaries' accounts, to be lagging behind other nation-states and to be losing the race to divide up the rest of the globe. This book is an ambitious re-assessment of how Wilhelmine Germans conceived of themselves and the German Empire's place in the world in the lead-up to the First World War. Mark Hewitson re-examines the varying forms of national identification, allegiance and politics following the creation and consolidation of a German nation-state in light of contemporary debates about modernity, race, industrialization, colonialism and military power. Despite the new claims being made for the importance of empire to Germany's development, he reveals that the majority of transnational networks and contemporaries' interactions and horizons remained intra-European or transatlantic rather than truly global.

Title: Britain's experience of empire in the twentieth century 
Abstract: Written by specialists from various fields, this edited volume is the first systematic investigation of the impact of imperialism on twentieth-century Britain. The contributors explore different aspects of Britain's imperial experience as the empire weathered the storms of the two world wars, was subsequently dismantled, and then apparently was gone. How widely was the empire's presence felt in British culture and society? What was the place of imperial questions in British party politics? Was Britain's status as a global power enhanced or underpinned by the existence of its empire? What was the relation of Britain's empire to national identities within the United Kingdom?

Title: New media literacies and participatory popular culture across borders 
Abstract: How do students' online literacy practices intersect with online popular culture? In this book scholars from a range of countries including Australia, Lebanon, Nepal, Qatar, South Africa, Turkey, and the United States illustrate and analyze how literacy practices that are mediated through and influenced by popular culture create both opportunities and tensions for secondary and university students. The authors examine issues of theory, identity, and pedagogy as they address participatory popular culture sites such as fan forums, video, blogs, social networking sites, anime, memes, and comics and graphic novels. Uniquely bringing together scholarship about online literacy practices and the growing body of work on participatory popular culture, New Media Literacies and Participatory Popular Culture across Borders makes distinctive contributions to an emerging field of study, pushing forward scholarship about literacy and identity in cross-cultural situations and advancing important conversations about issues of global flows and local responses to popular culture-- Provided by publisher.

Title:  Sports Injuries  
Abstract: Objectives: To explore the performance of retrospective health data collected from athletes before Athletics championships for the analysis of risk factors for in-competition injury and illness (I&I). Methods: For the 2013 European Athletics Indoor Championships, a self-report questionnaire (PHQ) was developed to record the health status of 127 athletes during the 4 weeks prior to the championship. Physician-based surveillance of in-competition I&I among all 577 athletes registered to compete was pursued during the championships. Results: 74 athletes (58.3%) from the sample submitted a complete PHQ, 21 (28%) of these athletes sustained at least one injury and/or illness during the championships. Training more than 12 h/week predisposed for sustaining an in-competition injury, and a recent health problem for in-competition illness. Among the 577 registered athletes, 60 injuries (104/1000 registered athletes) were reported. 31% of injuries were caused by the track, and 29% by overuse. 29 illnesses were reported (50/1000 registered athletes); upper respiratory tract infection and gastro-enteritis/diarrhoea were the most reported diagnoses. Conclusions: Pre-participation screening using athletes' self-report PHQ showed promising results with regard to identification of individuals at risk. Indoor injury types could be attributed to extrinsic factors, such as small track size, track inclination, and race tactics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Audit analytics in the financial industry 
Abstract: In Audit Analytics in the Financial Industry, editors Jun Dai, Miklos A. Vasarhelyi and Ann F. Medinets bring together a cast of expert contributors to explore ways to integrate Audit Analytics techniques into existing audit programs for the financial industry. Separated into six parts, the contributors take a variety of approaches to this exploration. In Part One, the contributors present two articles illustrating the process of applying Audit Analytics to solving audit problems. Part Two contains four studies that use various Audit Analytics techniques to discover fraud risks and potential frauds in the credit card sector. In Part Three, the chapter focus on the insurance sector and show the application of clustering techniques in auditing. Part Four includes two chapters on how to employ Audit Analytics in the transitory system for fraudanomaly detection. Finally, Parts Five and Six illustrate the use of Audit Analytics to assess risk in the lawsuit and payment processes. For students, researchers, and professionals in the accounting sector, this is an unmissable read exploring the latest research in Audit Analytics.

Title:  Ankylosing Spondylitis  
Abstract: Background: Through mounting genetic investigations, it has been established that IL12B and IL23R gene single nucleotide polymorphisms have significant associations with autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. IL-12/IL-23 pathway plays a pivotal role in etiopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), suggested by studies both in patients and animal models. Methods: In a case-control study, 145 MS patients and 200 healthy subjects were genotyped for polymorphisms in IL12B and IL23R genes using Real-Time PCR allelic discrimination approach. Additionally, quantitative analysis of mRNA expression of IL12B in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from patients and controls was conducted through Real-Time PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay. Results: The rs6887695 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IL12B gene showed an association with susceptibility to MS. GG genotype of this variation was more frequent in patients. mRNA expression of IL12B was upregulated in patients. Expression of IL12B mRNA in both MS patients collectively and those with GG genotype for rs6887695 SNP correlated negatively with onset age of MS patients. Conclusions: The GG genotype of rs6887695 SNP in IL12B gene plays a role in etiopathogenesis of MS.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Suspension Bridge  
Abstract: Numerous long-span bridges have been built throughout the world in recent years. It is desirable but very challenging to detect local abnormalities of a long-span bridge at the early stage. Stress influence lines (SIL) or its derivatives are recognized as very promising indices for damage detection. This paper explores a novel damage localization approach by synthesizing SIL measurements from multiple locations, in which Dempster-Shafer data fusion technique is utilized. Compared with the measurement from a single sensor, more reliable damage-related information with the improved sensitivity and capability in damage localization can be obtained by synthesizing the measured SILs from a number of sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a numerical case study of the Tsing Ma Suspension Bridge. Different hypothetical scenarios, including single-damage case, double-damage, and no-damage cases, are considered in the validation. The comparison with the damage detection results using single-sensor data clearly indicates that the data fusion technique effectively enhance the consistency in the information (e.g., damage-induced structural change) and minimize non-consistent information (e.g. ""noise"" effect) from multiple sensors installed close to damage. The increasing number of sensors benefits the damage detection results. Excellent damage detection accuracy can be achieved, if different types of bridge components are properly selected for the monitoring. Therefore, it is promising to use the proposed approach in this study in the damage localization of real-world long-span bridges. Parametric studies are conducted to examine the effects of parameter selections and noise levels in this approach.

Title:  Leadership  
Abstract: This article re-visits the relationship between teacher beliefs and teaching behaviours and analyses factors influencing the translation of teacher beliefs into teaching behaviours using the case of developing generic skills for university students. Through interviews with 16 teachers of skills subjects and 25 teachers of specialised subjects of the Business Administration programs in six different Vietnamese universities, it was shown that there was an indirect relationship between teacher beliefs and their teaching behaviours. The analysis showed that institutional leadership and teachers' personal motivation could strongly influence the translation of their beliefs into actual teaching behaviours. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Allowed categories (output MUST match these names EXACTLY):

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title: Boomerang
Abstract: As Pogo once said, We have met the enemy and he is us. In this book the author offers a scathing assessment of fiscal blunders in foreign lands, and details how economic repercussions are sure to be felt on American soil. Financial bubbles grew and burst, not only in the U.S. but in countries as diverse as Iceland, Germany, and Greece. Mixing humor with prescient insight, he depicts a precarious situation that demands attention. The tsunami of cheap credit that rolled across the planet between 2002 and 2008 was more than a simple financial phenomenon: it was temptation, offering entire societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not normally afford to indulge. Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a piñata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish. This investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, D.C., we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the reckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations. - Publisher.

Title: Fishing
Abstract: Humanity's last major source of food from the wild, and how it enabled and shaped the growth of civilization In this history of fishing-not as sport but as sustenance-archaeologist and best-selling author Brian Fagan argues that fishing was an indispensable and often overlooked element in the growth of civilization. It sustainably provided enough food to allow cities, nations, and empires to grow, but it did so with a different emphasis. Where agriculture encouraged stability, fishing demanded movement. It frequently required a search for new and better fishing grounds; its technologies, centered on boats, facilitated movement and discovery; and fish themselves, when dried and salted, were the ideal food-lightweight, nutritious, and long-lasting-for traders, travelers, and conquering armies. This history of the long interaction of humans and seafood tours archaeological sites worldwide to show readers how fishing fed human settlement, rising social complexity, the development of cities, and ultimately the modern world.

Title:  Electrical network  
Abstract: In this article the authors present theoretical and experimental studies of gas-burning devices with the chordal feed of gas jets. The optimum diameter of the nozzles providing for the necessary range of gas jets for a high-quality mixing of fuel gas and air in the mixing chamber of minimum length is determined by calculation. The analysis of the parameters of the flame indirectly proves the reliability of the calculated data. The chordal flow of the gas jets and optimization of their range will significantly reduce the overall structural dimensions of the gas burner units. Short-flame gas-burning devices formed the basis for the creation of the Autonomous heat gun intended for repair and maintenance of engineering networks. Obtaining of a good heat gun is ensured by the motor fan capable of generating a high-pressure jet without connection to an external electrical network. Using of the autonomous heat gun in the housing and communal services is very promising in comparison with similar devices. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  Computer vision  
Abstract: The accuracy of imaging for bulk volume estimation of apple slices in the process of drying at temperatures from 40 to 80 degrees C was investigated and compared with physical caliper measurements. The initial hypothesis was to estimate bulk volume of cylindrically shaped apple slices from diameter and thickness imaging. Imaging of diameter showed strong agreement with caliper measurements throughout the entire drying process, however imaging of thickness was not accurate due to the irregular shrinkage and bending phenomena. A linear model reflecting the relationship between diameter and bulk volume was developed and validated at temperatures of 40, 60, and 80 degrees C. It showed good correlation between imaging diameter and bulk volume changes in the range of moisture contents from 9.1 to 0.25 g/g. The relative percentage error of the prediction model was approximately 6.45%, which suggests that imaging can be used as a robust tool for bulk volume estimation of apple slices during convective drying.

Title: The positive social worker 
Abstract: Developed from the author's own experiences in social work and social work education, this book considers alternative approaches for social workers in dealing with the extensive demands, persistent pressures, and stress that they may face in their daily working lives. The Positive Social Worker is firmly located in an individual, group, organisational, cultural and socio-political context. It considers and celebrates concepts linked to the importance, and sources, of work-related well-being. Individual chapters describe and critically analyse the social work context, the role of hope, optimism, commitment, resilience, support, appraisals, positive emotions and coping, self-efficacy, control and agency. Throughout clear links are made with social work practice. While the book concentrates on a UK context, it draws on literature from social work, social, organisational, work and positive psychology and sociology, from the UK, the USA, Europe, Australasia and other countries. This book should be considered essential reading for social workers, graduate and post graduate social work students, practice educators and lecturers. It will also be of relevance to professionals and professionals in training in the criminal justice and health and social care fields--

Title:  Gender roles  
Abstract: Japan is leading the global trend of decreasing birth rates and the graying of society. In this study we examine women's changing gender and intergenerational relationships and how these affect their concerns and hopes for their futures. Many of the 121 midlife women (aged 45-55) interviewed viewed themselves as sandwiched between their mothers-in-law and actual or potential daughters-in-law, at the nadir of intergenerational status within their families, in large part due to changing social patterns in marriage and birth rates. Doubts about the marriageability of their sons arising from role expectations for brides to care for parents-in-law cause concern for many and highlight the gendered and intergenerational nature of aging concerns. Yet, midlife in the 21st century, with changing gender and intergenerational roles, appears to create opportunities for many Japanese women to reflect on the meaning of the next stage of their lives. Changing gender and intergenerational relationships may contribute to their hopes to live a life of self-actualization and to be true to one's self (jibun rashiku ikiru).

Title: Making news at The New York Times 
Abstract: Making News at The New York Times is the first in-depth portrait of the nation's, if not the world's, premier newspaper in the digital age. It presents a lively chronicle of months spent in the newsroom observing daily conversations, meetings, and journalists at work. We see Page One meetings, articles developed for online and print from start to finish, the creation of ambitious multimedia projects, and the ethical dilemmas posed by social media in the newsroom. Here, the reality of creating news in a 247 instant information environment clashes with the storied history of print journalism, and the tensions present a dramatic portrait of news in the online world.This news ethnography brings to bear the overarching value clashes at play in a digital news world. The book argues that emergent news values are reordering the fundamental processes of news production. Immediacy, interactivity, and participation now play a role unlike any time before, creating clashes between old and new. These values emerge from the social practices, pressures, and norms at play inside the newsroom as journalists attempt to negotiate the new demands of their work. Immediacy forces journalists to work in a constant deadline environment, an ASAP world, but one where the vaunted traditions of yesterday's news still appear in the next day's print paper. Interactivity, inspired by the new user-computer directed capacities online and the immersive Web environment, brings new kinds of specialists into the newsroom, but exacts new demands upon the already taxed workflow of traditional journalists. And at time where social media presents the opportunity for new kinds of engagement between the audience and media, business executives hope for branding opportunities while journalists fail to truly interact with their readers--

Title: Tales of unrest 
Abstract: The five stories brought together in Tales of Unrest (1898) mark a turning point in the writer's career. Conrad's first short story collection evidences a writer firmly in control of his new craft staking a claim to diverse cultural and fictional territories. The introduction situates the writing of these stories in Conrad's career and discusses their sources and contemporary reception. The explanatory notes identify literary and historical references and real-life places, and indicate influences. Two maps and six illustrations enrich the explanatory matter. The essay on the text lays out the history of the work's composition and publication, details interventions by Conrad's typists, compositors and editors, and explains editorial policy. This edition, established through modern textual scholarship, presents Conrad's stories and his preface to the collection in forms more authoritative than any so far printed--

Title: The joy of set
Abstract: Have you ever played the addictive card game SET? Have you ever wondered about the connections between games and mathematics? If the answer to either question is yes, then The Joy of SET is the book for you! The Joy of SET takes readers on a fascinating journey into this seemingly simple card game and reveals its surprisingly deep and diverse mathematical dimensions. Absolutely no mathematical background is necessary to enjoy this book-all you need is a sense of curiosity and adventure!Originally invented in 1974 by Marsha Falco and officially released in 1991, SET has gained a widespread, loyal following. SET's eighty-one cards consist of one, two, or three symbols of different shapes (diamond, oval, squiggle), shadings (solid, striped, open), and colors (green, purple, red). In order to win, players must identify sets of three cards for which each characteristic is the same-or different-on all the cards. SET's strategic and unique design opens connections to a plethora of mathematical disciplines, including geometry, modular arithmetic, combinatorics, probability, linear algebra, and computer simulations. The Joy of SET looks at these areas as well as avenues for further mathematical exploration. As the authors show, the relationship between SET and mathematics runs in both directions-playing this game has generated new mathematics, and the math has led to new questions about the game itself.The first book devoted to the mathematics of one of today's most popular card games, The Joy of SET will entertain and enlighten the game enthusiast in all of us.

Title:  Parallel computing  
Abstract: Phase analysis techniques of fringe patterns have been widely used for noncontact three-dimensional shape and deformation measurement by the fringe projection method. Recently, we developed two novel accurate phase analysis methods. One is the two-dimensional sampling moire method to perform robust phase analysis for a single-shot fringe pattern. The other is the two-dimensional spatiotemporal phase-shifting method to analyze phase distribution accurately for multi-step phase-shifted fringe patterns. To perform accurate phase analysis under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, both the above two methods use the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform or fast Fourier transform. Therefore, these algorithms are computationally expensive compared with the conventional one-dimensional sampling moire and phase-shifting methods. In this study, a fast parallelization implementation for two-dimensional phase-shifting methods, including the two-dimensional sampling moire method and the spatiotemporal phase-shifting method, are presented by utilizing multi-core CPU. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that phase analysis can reach 7.5 and 5.9 times faster by use of a 12-core CPU compared with a single CPU.

Title: Corporate governance in the banking sector in China 
Abstract: Focusing on the dichotomous and comparative analysis of the legitimacy, paradigm, and operating frames of bank governance and its reproduction in the new financial regime following the global financial crisis, this book examines in depth how corporate governance in bank institutions is legitimized, justified, and delivered in diversified financial models and their influences on the Chinese banking industry. By combining this type of financial model analysis with the new institutionalism theory, the book lifts the mysterious veil from corporate governance in Chinese banking institutions with regard to its establishment and constant changes. Through a kaleidoscope lens and by conducting a “layer by layer” diagnosis, the book tells the “background stories” of the complex settings for Chinese financial institutions, asks and answers the paradigmatic question of for whom banks are actually run and governed, and mind-maps the main corporate governance mechanisms and practices prevalent in Chinese banks.

Title: The driver in the driverless car
Abstract: A computer beats the reigning human champion of Go, a game harder than chess. Another is composing classical music. Labs are creating life-forms from synthetic DNA. A doctor designs an artificial trachea, uses a 3D printer to produce it, and implants it and saves a child's life. Astonishing technological advances like these are arriving in increasing numbers. Scholar and entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa uses this book to alert us to dozens of them and raise important questions about what they may mean for us. Breakthroughs such as personalized genomics, self-driving vehicles, drones, and artificial intelligence could make our lives healthier, safer, and easier. But the same technologies raise the specter of a frightening, alienating future: eugenics, a jobless economy, complete loss of privacy, and ever-worsening economic inequality. As Wadhwa puts it, our choices will determine if our future is Star Trek or Mad Max.

Abstract: Despite their hopeful aspirations to wholeness in life and spirit, Thomas McFarland contends, the Romantics were ruins amidst ruins,” fragments of human existence in a disintegrating world. Focusing on Wordsworth and Coleridge, Professor McFarland shows how this was true not only for each of these Romantics in particular but also for Romanticism in general.

- Economics:
  The social science that systematically analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, examining how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It employs theoretical models and empirical methods to study markets, trade, economic systems, and the factors influencing economic growth, stability, and overall societal welfare.

- Labor economics:
  The branch of economics that focuses on the functioning and dynamics of labor markets, analyzing the interactions between workers and employers. It studies wage determination, employment levels, unemployment, labor force participation, human capital (education and training), labor productivity, labor mobility, and the impact of labor unions, government policies, and demographic changes on workforce outcomes.

- Financial economics:
  The field of economics concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment. It studies financial markets, the pricing of financial assets (like stocks and bonds), corporate finance (including investment and financing decisions), risk management, portfolio theory, and the behavior of investors and financial institutions.

- Economics of land and energy:
  The specialized area of economics that analyzes the allocation, use, and valuation of land and natural resources, with a particular focus on energy resources. It examines markets for land, real estate, and energy commodities (like oil, gas, and electricity), studies the economic impact of resource scarcity and depletion, and evaluates policies related to land use, resource extraction, energy production, and environmental sustainability.

- Cooperatives:
  Autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In economics, the study of cooperatives analyzes their organizational structure, governance, economic efficiency, role in markets (particularly in agriculture, retail, housing, and finance), and their impact on member welfare and community development compared to traditional investor-owned firms.

- Socialism and related systems:
  A range of economic systems and theories characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as opposed to private ownership. Economic analysis of socialism examines its theoretical models (from market socialism to centrally planned economies), its mechanisms for resource allocation and income distribution, its historical implementations, and its comparative performance in terms of efficiency, equity, and growth relative to capitalist systems.

- Public finance:
  The study of the role of government in the economy, focusing on government revenue (primarily taxation), government expenditure, public debt, and fiscal policy. It analyzes how governments raise resources, allocate them through budgeting and spending programs (on areas like defense, education, and healthcare), redistribute income, and influence macroeconomic outcomes such as economic stability and growth.

- International economics:
  The branch of economics that studies economic interactions between nations, focusing on international trade and international finance. It analyzes patterns of trade, the gains from trade, trade policies (like tariffs and quotas), exchange rates, balance of payments, international capital flows, and the economic integration of countries through agreements and institutions.

- Production:
  The process of transforming inputs (such as labor, capital, raw materials, and technology) into outputs of goods and services. In economics, the study of production involves analyzing production functions, efficiency, costs, economies of scale, technological change, and the organization of firms and industries to understand how resources are combined to create economic value.

- Macroeconomics and related topics:
  The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on aggregate measures such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and the business cycle. Macroeconomics analyzes the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors on overall economic activity and seeks to develop policies for achieving stable prices, full employment, and sustainable growth.

Title:  State space representation  
Abstract: This work presents a general state-space representation of a multi-machine, multi-order power system model, which may be used to carry out small-signal stability assessments. Computational software coded in MATLAB has been developed in order to find and analyse the solution of an arbitrary number of synchronous generators in the network. Each generator is represented by a pre-defined model. The model choice is tailored to fit the available data for each generator. The software has provisions for conducting power flow solutions and the calculation of the initial state that the generators keep prior to the disturbance. The state-space representation and the equivalent transfer function matrix of the system are generated automatically. Eigenvalue analysis may be carried out using the standard MATLAB functionality. The paper is one of a tutorial nature and in order to check on the sanity of the results given by the new software, two text-book networks have been examined. The results were also compared with those generated using commercial industrial-grade software. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title:  Nonverbal communication  
Abstract: Younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; high-risk siblings) exhibit lower levels of initiating joint attention (IJA; sharing an object or experience with a social partner through gaze and/or gesture) than low-risk siblings of children without ASD. However, high-risk siblings also exhibit substantial variability in this domain. The neurotransmitter dopamine is linked to brain areas associated with reward, motivation, and attention, and common dopaminergic variants have been associated with attention difficulties. We examined whether these common dopaminergic variants, DRD4 and DRD2, explain variability in IJA in high-risk (n=55) and low-risk (n=38) siblings. IJA was assessed in the first year during a semi-structured interaction with an examiner. DRD4 and DRD2 genotypes were coded according to associated dopaminergic functioning to create a gene score, with higher scores indicating more genotypes associated with less efficient dopaminergic functioning. Higher dopamine gene scores (indicative of less efficient dopaminergic functioning) were associated with lower levels of IJA in the first year for high-risk siblings, while the opposite pattern emerged in low-risk siblings. Findings suggest differential susceptibilityIJA was differentially associated with dopaminergic functioning depending on familial ASD risk. Understanding genes linked to ASD-relevant behaviors in high-risk siblings will aid in early identification of children at greatest risk for difficulties in these behavioral domains, facilitating targeted prevention and intervention.

Title:  Suspension Bridge  
Abstract: Over the course of the past 150 years, since the first iron- and steel-based bridge was constructed in 1868, Japan has become one of the most advanced countries in the construction of steel structures. Various innovative and elegant steel structures were constructed in the past such as the world's longest suspension bridge called the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. The advances of steel structures were attributed to a significant extent to the development of high-performance steels. Such materials developed in Japan were characterized by three types of versatilities: strength, functional, and sectional. Some examples of such materials include fairly high and low strength steels, high-bridge performance steel, seismic-resistant steel, fire-resistant steel, and size-flexible H-shaped beam. In Japan, these steel material innovations enabled the progress in steel structures to leap forward and in turn challenging new structures gave birth to further advancements in steel materials. In this paper, the advancements of steel structures and materials were reviewed, focusing largely on the steel materials and their contributions to the construction of steel structures. In addition, in light of recently developed innovative steels and their strength-increasing potential, the further advancements of steel materials were suggested for the future innovations of steel structures.

- Social processes:
  The patterned sequences of social activity that produce, maintain, and transform social structures over time, including processes such as socialization, stratification, conflict, cooperation, social change, and institutional development that shape the organization and evolution of societies.

- Factors affecting social behavior:
  The diverse influences that shape individual and collective actions within social contexts, encompassing psychological factors (attitudes, beliefs, emotions), social factors (norms, roles, group pressure), cultural factors (values, traditions, symbols), and structural factors (institutions, resources, power relations) that determine how people behave in social situations.

- Groups of people:
  Collections of individuals who share common characteristics, interests, or social connections and interact with one another, ranging from small primary groups like families and friendship circles to large secondary groups such as organizations, social classes, ethnic communities, and demographic categories that form the building blocks of social structure.

- Culture and institutions:
  The interrelated systems that organize social life, where culture comprises the shared beliefs, values, norms, symbols, and practices that guide behavior within a society, while institutions represent the established patterns of social organization and rules that structure key areas of collective life such as family, education, religion, economy, and government.

- Communities:
  Social units characterized by shared territory, interests, identity, or social ties that create a sense of belonging and mutual support among members, ranging from geographically based neighborhoods and towns to interest-based communities and virtual networks that provide social cohesion and collective identity.

Decision procedure (MANDATORY):
1. Compare the Title and Abstract against EACH category description.
2. Select the categories whose descriptions can explain the text with the FEWEST additional assumptions.
3. Rank categories by degree of semantic coverage.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless the total number of allowed categories is less than 5, in which case return all of them).
5. If only 1-2 categories are strong matches, you MUST fill the remaining slots with the next most plausible categories, even if their confidence is low (e.g., 0.05). Do NOT return fewer than 5 items.

Confidence assignment rules (MANDATORY — this is rule 4):
- Confidence represents SEMANTIC EXCLUSIVITY, not model certainty.
- If two or more categories plausibly explain the text, the top confidence MUST be reduced.
- In ambiguous or interdisciplinary cases, the highest confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.75.
- The sum of confidence scores does not need to equal 1.0.
- Use low confidence scores (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15) for forced filling items.

Output rules:
1) Output MUST be a single valid JSON object. No extra text. No markdown.
2) Return EXACTLY 5 predictions (unless total categories < 5).
3) Use EXACT category names from the allowed list.
4) JSON schema:
{
  ""predictions"": [
    {""category"": ""<exact allowed name>"", ""confidence"": <float 0.00 to 1.00>},
    ...
  ]
}
5) confidence MUST be a float in [0, 1] with up to 2 decimal places.

Now classify the following text STRICTLY using the rules above:

Title: Principles and methods of social research 
Abstract: This classic text presents the most recent advances in social research design and methodology. Users applaud the book's comprehensiveness. It reviews experimental, correlational, quasi experimental, and evalaution designs to survey sampling, interviewing, content analysis, questionaire design, scale developments, and assessing dyads and groups. The research process is described using basic principles of scientific inquiry and how they apply to the study of human behavior. Design issues are emphasized over statistical computations. The book helps readers apply sound scientific analysis to better understand what it means to be human, making it an indispensable resource in the fields of psychology, communication, sociology, education, health, and marketing. With a heavy emphasis on reliability, validity, and measurement, the book considers experimental, quasi-experimental, and survey research designs in light of these qualities. Principles and Methods of Social Research is noted for its: -Emphasis on understanding the principles that govern the use of a method to facilitate the researcher's choice of the best technique for a given situation. - Use of the laboratory experiment to describe and evaluate field experiments, correlational designs, quasi experiments, evaluation studies, and survey designs. Coverage of the ethics of social research including the power a researcher wields and tips on how to use it responsibly. --
